  abstract = {Many developments have occurred since the publication of the widely-used 2009 Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Dyslipidemia guidelines. Here, we present an updated version of the guidelines, incorporating new recommendations based on recent findings and harmonizing CCS guidelines with those from other Societies. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used, per present standards of the CCS. The total cardiovascular disease Framingham Risk Score (FRS), modified for a family history of premature coronary disease, is recommended for risk assessment. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol remains the primary target of therapy. However, non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol has been added to apolipoprotein B as an alternate target. There is an increased emphasis on treatment of higher risk patients, including those with chronic kidney disease and high risk hypertension. The primary panel has recommended a judicious use of secondary testing for subjects in whom the need for statin therapy is unclear. Expanded information on health behaviours is presented and is the backbone of risk reduction in all subjects. Finally, a systematic approach to statin intolerance is advocated to maximize appropriate use of lipid-lowering therapy. This document presents the recommendations and principal conclusions of this process. Along with associated Supplementary Material that can be accessed online, this document will be part of a program of knowledge translation. The goal is to increase the appropriate use of evidence-based cardiovascular disease event risk assessment in the management of dyslipidemia as a fundamental means of reducing global risk in the Canadian population. R\'esum\'e De nombreux d\'eveloppements sont survenus depuis la publication commun\'ement utilis\'ee des Lignes directrices 2009 de la Soci\'et\'e canadienne de cardiologie (SCC) sur la dyslipid\'emie. Nous pr\'esentons ici une version mise \`a jour des lignes directrices, qui inclut des nouvelles recommandations fond\'ees sur des r\'esultats r\'ecents qui harmonisent les lignes directrices de la SCC \`a celles d'autres soci\'et\'es. La m\'ethode GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) a \'et\'e utilis\'ee selon les normes actuelles de la SCC. Le score de risque cardiovasculaire global de Framingham (SRF) total sur les maladies cardiovasculaires modifi\'e pour tenir compte des ant\'ec\'edents familiaux de coronaropathie pr\'ematur\'ee est recommand\'e pour l'\'evaluation du risque. Le cholest\'erol \`a lipoprot\'eines de faible densit\'e demeure la cible principale du traitement. Cependant, le cholest\'erol non \`a lipoprot\'eines de haute densit\'e a \'et\'e ajout\'e \`a l'apolipoprot\'eine B comme autre cible. L'accent est davantage mis sur le traitement des patients expos\'es \`a un risque \'elev\'e, incluant ceux ayant une maladie r\'enale chronique et une hypertension \`a risque \'elev\'e. Le panel principal a recommand\'e une utilisation judicieuse d'examens secondaires des sujets chez qui la n\'ecessit\'e d'un traitement par des statines est incertaine. De plus en plus de renseignements sur les comportements en mati\`ere de sant\'e sont pr\'esent\'es et sont les bases de la r\'eduction du risque chez tous les sujets. Finalement, une approche syst\'ematique sur l'intol\'erance aux statines est recommand\'ee pour optimiser l'utilisation de traitements hypolipid\'emiants. Ce document pr\'esente les recommandations et les conclusions principales de ce processus. Par les contenus compl\'ementaires associ\'es qui peuvent \^etre consult\'es en ligne, ce document fera partie d'un programme d'application des connaissances. Le but est d'accro\^itre l'utilisation appropri\'ee de l'\'evaluation des risques d'\'ev\'enements cardiovasculaires fond\'ee sur les preuves dans la prise en charge de la dyslipid\'emie en tant que moyen fondamental pour r\'eduire le risque global dans la population canadienne.},

  abstract = {Background Statin therapy has been shown to reduce major vascular events and vascular mortality in a wide range of individuals, but there is uncertainty about its efficacy and safety among older people. We undertook a meta-analysis of data from all large statin trials to compare the effects of statin therapy at different ages. Methods In this meta-analysis, randomised trials of statin therapy were eligible if they aimed to recruit at least 1000 participants with a scheduled treatment duration of at least 2 years. We analysed individual participant data from 22 trials (n=134\hphantom{,}537) and detailed summary data from one trial (n=12\hphantom{,}705) of statin therapy versus control, plus individual participant data from five trials of more intensive versus less intensive statin therapy (n=39\hphantom{,}612). We subdivided participants into six age groups (55 years or younger, 56\textendash 60 years, 61\textendash 65 years, 66\textendash 70 years, 71\textendash 75 years, and older than 75 years). We estimated effects on major vascular events (ie, major coronary events, strokes, and coronary revascularisations), cause-specific mortality, and cancer incidence as the rate ratio (RR) per 1{$\cdot$}0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol. We compared proportional risk reductions in different age subgroups by use of standard {$\chi$}2 tests for heterogeneity when there were two groups, or trend when there were more than two groups. Findings 14\hphantom{,}483 (8\%) of 186\hphantom{,}854 participants in the 28 trials were older than 75 years at randomisation, and the median follow-up duration was 4{$\cdot$}9 years. Overall, statin therapy or a more intensive statin regimen produced a 21\% (RR 0{$\cdot$}79, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}77\textendash 0{$\cdot$}81) proportional reduction in major vascular events per 1{$\cdot$}0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol. We observed a significant reduction in major vascular events in all age groups. Although proportional reductions in major vascular events diminished slightly with age, this trend was not statistically significant (ptrend=0{$\cdot$}06). Overall, statin or more intensive therapy yielded a 24\% (RR 0{$\cdot$}76, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}73\textendash 0{$\cdot$}79) proportional reduction in major coronary events per 1{$\cdot$}0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol, and with increasing age, we observed a trend towards smaller proportional risk reductions in major coronary events (ptrend=0{$\cdot$}009). We observed a 25\% (RR 0{$\cdot$}75, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}73\textendash 0{$\cdot$}78) proportional reduction in the risk of coronary revascularisation procedures with statin therapy or a more intensive statin regimen per 1{$\cdot$}0 mmol/L lower LDL cholesterol, which did not differ significantly across age groups (ptrend=0{$\cdot$}6). Similarly, the proportional reductions in stroke of any type (RR 0{$\cdot$}84, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}80\textendash 0{$\cdot$}89) did not differ significantly across age groups (ptrend=0{$\cdot$}7). After exclusion of four trials which enrolled only patients with heart failure or undergoing renal dialysis (among whom statin therapy has not been shown to be effective), the trend to smaller proportional risk reductions with increasing age persisted for major coronary events (ptrend=0{$\cdot$}01), and remained non-significant for major vascular events (ptrend=0{$\cdot$}3). The proportional reduction in major vascular events was similar, irrespective of age, among patients with pre-existing vascular disease (ptrend=0{$\cdot$}2), but appeared smaller among older than among younger individuals not known to have vascular disease (ptrend=0{$\cdot$}05). We found a 12\% (RR 0{$\cdot$}88, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}85\textendash 0{$\cdot$}91) proportional reduction in vascular mortality per 1{$\cdot$}0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol, with a trend towards smaller proportional reductions with older age (ptrend=0{$\cdot$}004), but this trend did not persist after exclusion of the heart failure or dialysis trials (ptrend=0{$\cdot$}2). Statin therapy had no effect at any age on non-vascular mortality, cancer death, or cancer incidence. Interpretation Statin therapy produces significant reductions in major vascular events irrespective of age, but there is less direct evidence of benefit among patients older than 75 years who do not already have evidence of occlusive vascular disease. This limitation is now being addressed by further trials.

  abstract = {Financial incentives to physicians or patients are increasingly used, but their effectiveness is not well established.To determine whether physician financial incentives, patient incentives, or shared physician and patient incentives are more effective than control in reducing levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) among patients with high cardiovascular risk.Four-group, multicenter, cluster randomized clinical trial with a 12-month intervention conducted from 2011 to 2014 in 3 primary care practices in the northeastern United States. Three hundred forty eligible primary care physicians (PCPs) were enrolled from a pool of 421. Of 25\,627 potentially eligible patients of those PCPs, 1503 enrolled. Patients aged 18 to 80 years were eligible if they had a 10-year Framingham Risk Score (FRS) of 20\% or greater, had coronary artery disease equivalents with LDL-C levels of 120 mg/dL or greater, or had an FRS of 10\% to 20\% with LDL-C levels of 140 mg/dL or greater. Investigators were blinded to study group, but participants were not.Primary care physicians were randomly assigned to control, physician incentives, patient incentives, or shared physician-patient incentives. Physicians in the physician incentives group were eligible to receive up to \$1024 per enrolled patient meeting LDL-C goals. Patients in the patient incentives group were eligible for the same amount, distributed through daily lotteries tied to medication adherence. Physicians and patients in the shared incentives group shared these incentives. Physicians and patients in the control group received no incentives tied to outcomes, but all patient participants received up to \$355 each for trial participation.Change in LDL-C level at 12 months.Patients in the shared physician-patient incentives group achieved a mean reduction in LDL-C of 33.6 mg/dL (95\% CI, 30.1-37.1; baseline, 160.1 mg/dL; 12 months, 126.4 mg/dL); those in physician incentives achieved a mean reduction of 27.9 mg/dL (95\% CI, 24.9-31.0; baseline, 159.9 mg/dL; 12 months, 132.0 mg/dL); those in patient incentives achieved a mean reduction of 25.1 mg/dL (95\% CI, 21.6-28.5; baseline, 160.6 mg/dL; 12 months, 135.5 mg/dL); and those in the control group achieved a mean reduction of 25.1 mg/dL (95\% CI, 21.7-28.5; baseline, 161.5 mg/dL; 12 months, 136.4 mg/dL; P\,\&lt;\,.001 for comparison of all 4 groups). Only patients in the shared physician-patient incentives group achieved reductions in LDL-C levels statistically different from those in the control group (8.5 mg/dL; 95\% CI, 3.8-13.3; P\,=\,.002).In primary care practices, shared financial incentives for physicians and patients, but not incentives to physicians or patients alone, resulted in a statistically significant difference in reduction of LDL-C levels at 12 months. This reduction was modest, however, and further information is needed to understand whether this approach represents good value.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier:NCT01346189},

  abstract = {There is considerable evidence to suggest that the identification and treatment of dyslipidaemia will reduce the risk of premature CHD, i.e. before the age of 65. Diagnosis of the cause of raised plasma lipid levels will enable appropriate decisions to be taken with regard to management. The cornerstone of treatment is nutritional counselling and attention to other major risk factors for CHD, particularly smoking and hypertension. For a small percentage of patients with severe hyperlipidaemia drug therapy is indicated. Appropriate drug choices need to be made based on the particular lipid abnormality to be treated. In general those patients with clinical vascular disease are treated more aggressively than those where the aim is primary prevention. More research is needed to determine individual risk more precisely and to allow proper targeting of therapy. Genetic factors, qualitative changes in lipoproteins, lipoprotein (a), fibrinogen, and other coagulation and thrombotic factors are likely to be important in individual risk assessment. There is no doubt that more information is needed from prospective studies of lipid-lowering therapy in terms of risk benefit for affected individuals. Hopefully the major studies currently underway will fill some of the gaps in our knowledge. Until then aggressive therapy with drugs should be reserved for those at highest risk where the benefit is likely to be greatest.},

  abstract = {Plasma levels of lipids and lipoproteins are essential to the management of lipid disorders by generalists and by practitioners of the emerging specialty of clinical lipidology. The routine lipid panel consists of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides. Several additional lipid parameters are emerging as potentially valuable adjuncts to the standard panel, including measurements of apolipoproteins and LDL particle size and concentration, but most of these serve mainly as research tools at present. One major exception is non\textendash HDL-C, which is readily available for routine clinical use. This review outlines some of the numerous research studies that clearly establish the clinical utility and even preeminence of non\textendash HDL-C as a comprehensive measure of atherogenic lipoproteins. Non\textendash HDL-C was highlighted as a key secondary goal of therapy several years ago in the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III national lipid treatment guidelines and recently was further emphasized as a major goal of therapy in the consensus guidelines for lipoprotein management in patients with cardiometabolic risk from the American Diabetes Association and the American College of Cardiology. Non\textendash HDL-C is superior to LDL-C for the prediction of cardiovascular events and has many other compelling advantages over LDL-C and other traditional lipid parameters. Importantly, it can be calculated directly from values in routine lipid panels, at no added expense. It is our opinion that non\textendash HDL-C should be reported on all routine lipid profiles and used regularly in the management of dyslipidemia for optimal prevention of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.},

But each separate trial has limited power to assess particular outcomes or particular categories of participant. Methods A prospective meta-analysis of data from 90\hphantom{,}056 individuals in 14 randomised trials of statins was done. Weighted estimates were obtained of effects on different clinical outcomes per 1{$\cdot$}0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol. Findings During a mean of 5 years, there were 8186 deaths, 14\hphantom{,}348 individuals had major vascular events, and 5103 developed cancer. Mean LDL cholesterol differences at 1 year ranged from 0{$\cdot$}35 mmol/L to 1{$\cdot$}77 mmol/L (mean 1{$\cdot$}09) in these trials. There was a 12\% proportional reduction in all-cause mortality per mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol (rate ratio [RR] 0{$\cdot$}88, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}84\textendash 0{$\cdot$}91; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). This reflected a 19\% reduction in coronary mortality (0{$\cdot$}81, 0{$\cdot$}76\textendash 0{$\cdot$}85; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001), and non-significant reductions in non-coronary vascular mortality (0{$\cdot$}93, 0{$\cdot$}83\textendash 1{$\cdot$}03; p=0{$\cdot$}2) and non-vascular mortality (0{$\cdot$}95, 0{$\cdot$}90\textendash 1{$\cdot$}01; p=0{$\cdot$}1). There were corresponding reductions in myocardial infarction or coronary death (0{$\cdot$}77, 0{$\cdot$}74\textendash 0{$\cdot$}80; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001), in the need for coronary revascularisation (0{$\cdot$}76, 0{$\cdot$}73\textendash 0{$\cdot$}80; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001), in fatal or non-fatal stroke (0{$\cdot$}83, 0{$\cdot$}78\textendash 0{$\cdot$}88; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001), and, combining these, of 21\% in any such major vascular event (0{$\cdot$}79, 0{$\cdot$}77\textendash 0{$\cdot$}81; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). The proportional reduction in major vascular events differed significantly (p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001) according to the absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol achieved, but not otherwise. These benefits were significant within the first year, but were greater in subsequent years. Taking all years together, the overall reduction of about one fifth per mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction translated into 48 (95\% CI 39\textendash 57) fewer participants having major vascular events per 1000 among those with pre-existing CHD at baseline, compared with 25 (19\textendash 31) per 1000 among participants with no such history. There was no evidence that statins increased the incidence of cancer overall (1{$\cdot$}00, 0{$\cdot$}95\textendash 1{$\cdot$}06; p=0{$\cdot$}9) or at any particular site. Interpretation Statin therapy can safely reduce the 5-year incidence of major coronary events, coronary revascularisation, and stroke by about one fifth per mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol, largely irrespective of the initial lipid profile or other presenting characteristics. The absolute benefit relates chiefly to an individual's absolute risk of such events and to the absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol achieved. These findings reinforce the need to consider prolonged statin treatment with substantial LDL cholesterol reductions in all patients at high risk of any type of major vascular event.},

  abstract = {Background Lowering of LDL cholesterol with standard statin regimens reduces the risk of occlusive vascular events in a wide range of individuals. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of more intensive lowering of LDL cholesterol with statin therapy. Methods We undertook meta-analyses of individual participant data from randomised trials involving at least 1000 participants and at least 2 years' treatment duration of more versus less intensive statin regimens (five trials; 39\hphantom{,}612 individuals; median follow-up 5{$\cdot$}1 years) and of statin versus control (21 trials; 129\hphantom{,}526 individuals; median follow-up 4{$\cdot$}8 years). For each type of trial, we calculated not only the average risk reduction, but also the average risk reduction per 1{$\cdot$}0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction at 1 year after randomisation. Findings In the trials of more versus less intensive statin therapy, the weighted mean further reduction in LDL cholesterol at 1 year was 0{$\cdot$}51 mmol/L. Compared with less intensive regimens, more intensive regimens produced a highly significant 15\% (95\% CI 11\textendash 18; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001) further reduction in major vascular events, consisting of separately significant reductions in coronary death or non-fatal myocardial infarction of 13\% (95\% CI 7\textendash 19; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001), in coronary revascularisation of 19\% (95\% CI 15\textendash 24; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001), and in ischaemic stroke of 16\% (95\% CI 5\textendash 26; p=0{$\cdot$}005). Per 1{$\cdot$}0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol, these further reductions in risk were similar to the proportional reductions in the trials of statin versus control. When both types of trial were combined, similar proportional reductions in major vascular events per 1{$\cdot$}0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction were found in all types of patient studied (rate ratio [RR] 0{$\cdot$}78, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}76\textendash 0{$\cdot$}80; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001), including those with LDL cholesterol lower than 2 mmol/L on the less intensive or control regimen. Across all 26 trials, all-cause mortality was reduced by 10\% per 1{$\cdot$}0 mmol/L LDL reduction (RR 0{$\cdot$}90, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}87\textendash 0{$\cdot$}93; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001), largely reflecting significant reductions in deaths due to coronary heart disease (RR 0{$\cdot$}80, 99\% CI 0{$\cdot$}74\textendash 0{$\cdot$}87; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001) and other cardiac causes (RR 0{$\cdot$}89, 99\% CI 0{$\cdot$}81\textendash 0{$\cdot$}98; p=0{$\cdot$}002), with no significant effect on deaths due to stroke (RR 0{$\cdot$}96, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}84\textendash 1{$\cdot$}09; p=0{$\cdot$}5) or other vascular causes (RR 0{$\cdot$}98, 99\% CI 0{$\cdot$}81\textendash 1{$\cdot$}18; p=0{$\cdot$}8). No significant effects were observed on deaths due to cancer or other non-vascular causes (RR 0{$\cdot$}97, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}92\textendash 1{$\cdot$}03; p=0{$\cdot$}3) or on cancer incidence (RR 1{$\cdot$}00, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}96\textendash 1{$\cdot$}04; p=0{$\cdot$}9), even at low LDL cholesterol concentrations. Interpretation Further reductions in LDL cholesterol safely produce definite further reductions in the incidence of heart attack, of revascularisation, and of ischaemic stroke, with each 1{$\cdot$}0 mmol/L reduction reducing the annual rate of these major vascular events by just over a fifth. There was no evidence of any threshold within the cholesterol range studied, suggesting that reduction of LDL cholesterol by 2\textendash 3 mmol/L would reduce risk by about 40\textendash 50\%.

  abstract = {Background Statins reduce LDL cholesterol and prevent vascular events, but their net effects in people at low risk of vascular events remain uncertain. Methods This meta-analysis included individual participant data from 22 trials of statin versus control (n=134\hphantom{,}537; mean LDL cholesterol difference 1{$\cdot$}08 mmol/L; median follow-up 4{$\cdot$}8 years) and five trials of more versus less statin (n=39\hphantom{,}612; difference 0{$\cdot$}51 mmol/L; 5{$\cdot$}1 years). Major vascular events were major coronary events (ie, non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death), strokes, or coronary revascularisations. Participants were separated into five categories of baseline 5-year major vascular event risk on control therapy (no statin or low-intensity statin) ({$<$}5\%, {$\geq$}5\% to {$<$}10\%, {$\geq$}10\% to {$<$}20\%, {$\geq$}20\% to {$<$}30\%, {$\geq$}30\%); in each, the rate ratio (RR) per 1{$\cdot$}0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction was estimated. Findings Reduction of LDL cholesterol with a statin reduced the risk of major vascular events (RR 0{$\cdot$}79, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}77\textendash 0{$\cdot$}81, per 1{$\cdot$}0 mmol/L reduction), largely irrespective of age, sex, baseline LDL cholesterol or previous vascular disease, and of vascular and all-cause mortality. The proportional reduction in major vascular events was at least as big in the two lowest risk categories as in the higher risk categories (RR per 1{$\cdot$}0 mmol/L reduction from lowest to highest risk: 0{$\cdot$}62 [99\% CI 0{$\cdot$}47\textendash 0{$\cdot$}81], 0{$\cdot$}69 [99\% CI 0{$\cdot$}60\textendash 0{$\cdot$}79], 0{$\cdot$}79 [99\% CI 0{$\cdot$}74\textendash 0{$\cdot$}85], 0{$\cdot$}81 [99\% CI 0{$\cdot$}77\textendash 0{$\cdot$}86], and 0{$\cdot$}79 [99\% CI 0{$\cdot$}74\textendash 0{$\cdot$}84]; trend p=0{$\cdot$}04), which reflected significant reductions in these two lowest risk categories in major coronary events (RR 0{$\cdot$}57, 99\% CI 0{$\cdot$}36\textendash 0{$\cdot$}89, p=0{$\cdot$}0012, and 0{$\cdot$}61, 99\% CI 0{$\cdot$}50\textendash 0{$\cdot$}74, p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001) and in coronary revascularisations (RR 0{$\cdot$}52, 99\% CI 0{$\cdot$}35\textendash 0{$\cdot$}75, and 0{$\cdot$}63, 99\% CI 0{$\cdot$}51\textendash 0{$\cdot$}79; both p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). For stroke, the reduction in risk in participants with 5-year risk of major vascular events lower than 10\% (RR per 1{$\cdot$}0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction 0{$\cdot$}76, 99\% CI 0{$\cdot$}61\textendash 0{$\cdot$}95, p=0{$\cdot$}0012) was also similar to that seen in higher risk categories (trend p=0{$\cdot$}3). In participants without a history of vascular disease, statins reduced the risks of vascular (RR per 1{$\cdot$}0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction 0{$\cdot$}85, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}77\textendash 0{$\cdot$}95) and all-cause mortality (RR 0{$\cdot$}91, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}85\textendash 0{$\cdot$}97), and the proportional reductions were similar by baseline risk. There was no evidence that reduction of LDL cholesterol with a statin increased cancer incidence (RR per 1{$\cdot$}0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction 1{$\cdot$}00, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}96\textendash 1{$\cdot$}04), cancer mortality (RR 0{$\cdot$}99, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}93\textendash 1{$\cdot$}06), or other non-vascular mortality. Interpretation In individuals with 5-year risk of major vascular events lower than 10\%, each 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol produced an absolute reduction in major vascular events of about 11 per 1000 over 5 years. This benefit greatly exceeds any known hazards of statin therapy. Under present guidelines, such individuals would not typically be regarded as suitable for LDL-lowering statin therapy. The present report suggests, therefore, that these guidelines might need to be reconsidered.

  abstract = {PreambleGuidelines aim to present all the relevant evidence on a particular issue in order to help physicians to weigh the benefits and risks of a particular diagnostic or therapeutic procedure. They should be helpful in everyday clinical decision-making.A great number of guidelines have been issued in recent years by different organisations\textendash European Society of Cardiology (ESC), American Heart Association (AHA), American College of Cardiology (ACC), and other related societies. By means of links to web sites of National Societies several hundred guidelines are available. This profusion can put at stake the authority and validity of guidelines, which can only be guaranteed if they have been developed by an unquestionable decision-making process. This is one of the reasons why the ESC and others have issued recommendations for formulating and issuing guidelines.In spite of the fact that standards for issuing good quality guidelines are well defined, recent surveys of guidelines published in peer-reviewed journals between 1985 and 1998 have shown that methodological standards were not complied with in the vast majority of cases. It is therefore of great importance that guidelines and recommendations are presented in formats that are easily interpreted. Subsequently, their implementation programmes must also be well conducted. Attempts have been made to determine whether guidelines improve the quality of clinical practice and the utilisation of health resources. In addition, the legal implications of medical guidelines have been discussed and examined, resulting in position documents, which have been published by a specific task force. The ESC Committee for practice guidelines (CPG) supervises and coordinates the preparation of new guidelines and expert consensus documents produced by task forces, expert groups or consensus panels. The Committee is also responsible for the endorsement of these guidelines or statements.},

  abstract = {Background Despite the prognostic value of metabolic syndrome for predicting cardiovascular events, few trials have investigated the effects of statin therapy on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with the metabolic syndrome. Our post hoc analysis of the Treating to New Targets (TNT) study assessed whether intensive lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with high-dose atorvastatin therapy results in cardiovascular benefits for patients with both coronary heart disease and the metabolic syndrome. Methods The TNT study was a prospective, double blind, parallel-group trial done at 256 sites in 14 countries between April, 1998, and August, 2004, with a median follow-up of 4{$\cdot$}9 years. 10\hphantom{,}001 patients were enrolled aged 35\textendash 75 years with clinically evident coronary heart disease. Our analysis includes 5584 patients with metabolic syndrome based on the 2005 NCEP ATP III criteria. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either atorvastatin 10 mg per day (n=2820) or 80 mg per day (n=2764). The primary outcome measure was time to first major cardiovascular event, defined as death from coronary heart disease, non-fatal non-procedure-related myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or fatal or non-fatal stroke. Findings In patients with coronary heart disease and metabolic syndrome, mean on-treatment low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations at 3 months were 2{$\cdot$}6 mmol/L (99{$\cdot$}3 mg/dL) with atorvastatin 10 mg, and 1{$\cdot$}9 mmol/L (72{$\cdot$}6 mg/dL) with atorvastatin 80 mg. At a median follow-up of 4{$\cdot$}9 years, major cardiovascular events occurred in 367 (13\%) patients receiving atorvastatin 10 mg, compared with 262 (9{$\cdot$}5\%) receiving atorvastatin 80 mg (hazard ratio 0{$\cdot$}71; 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}61\textendash 0{$\cdot$}84; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). Irrespective of treatment assignment, significantly more patients with metabolic syndrome (11{$\cdot$}3\%) had a major cardiovascular event at a median of 4{$\cdot$}9 years than those without metabolic syndrome (8{$\cdot$}0\%; hazard ratio 1{$\cdot$}44; 95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}26\textendash 1{$\cdot$}64; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). This increased risk was significantly reduced by intensive therapy with atorvastatin 80 mg beyond that achieved with atorvastatin 10 mg. Interpretation These data indicate that patients with coronary heart disease and metabolic syndrome derive incremental benefit from high-dose atorvastatin therapy, irrespective of the presence of diabetes.},

  abstract = {Background Secondary prevention medications in cardiac patients improve outcomes. However, prescription rates for these drugs and long-term adherence are suboptimal. OBJECTIVE To determine whether an enhanced secondary prevention program improves outcomes. METHODS Hospitalized patients with indications for secondary prevention medications were randomly assigned to either usual care or an intervention arm, in which an intensive program was used to optimize prescription rates and long-term adherence. Follow-up was 19 months. Results A total of 2643 patients were randomly assigned in the study; 1342 patients were assigned to usual care and 1301 patients were assigned to the intervention arm. Prescription rates were near optimal except for lipid-lowering medications. Rehospitalization rates per 100 patients were 136.2 and 132.6 over 19 months in the usual care and intervention groups, respectively (P=0.59). Total days in hospital per patient were similar (10.9 days in the usual care group versus 10.2 days in the intervention group; P not significant). Crude mortality was 6.2\% and 5.5\% in the usual care and intervention groups, respectively, with no significant difference (P=0.15) in overall survival. Post hoc analysis suggested that after the study team became experienced, days in hospital per patient were reduced by the program (11.1{$\pm$}0.91 and 8.9{$\pm$}0.61 in the usual care and intervention groups, respectively; P{$<$}0.05). Conclusions The intervention program failed to improve outcomes in the present study. One explanation for these results is the near optimal physician compliance with guidelines in both groups. It is also possible that a substantial learning curve for the staff was involved, as suggested by the reduction in total days in hospital in the intervention patients during the second part of the study. Historique Les m\'edicaments de pr\'evention secondaire am\'eliorent les issues chez les patients cardiaques. Cependant, les taux de prescription de ces m\'edicaments et l'observance \`a long terme sont sous-optimaux. Objectif D\'eterminer si un programme de pr\'evention secondaire am\'elior\'e assure de meilleures issues. M\'ethodologie Des patients hospitalis\'es ayant des indications de prendre de m\'edicaments de pr\'evention secondaire ont \'et\'e divis\'es au hasard entre les soins habituels ou une intervention sous forme de programme intensif pour optimiser les taux de prescription et l'observance \`a long terme. Le suivi a dur\'e 19 mois. R\'esultats : Au total, 2 643 patients ont \'et\'e s\'electionn\'es au hasard dans l'\'etude : 1 342 patients ont \'et\'e attribu\'es au groupe de soins habituels, et 1 301 patients, au groupe d'intervention. Les taux de prescription \'etaient presque optimaux, sauf pour les m\'edicaments visant \`a r\'eduire les taux de lipide. Les taux de r\'ehospitalisation par tranche de 100 patients \'etaient de 136,2 et 132, 6 sur 19 mois au sein des groupes de soins habituels et d'intervention, respectivement (p=0,59). Les jours totaux d'hospitalisation par patient \'etaient similaires (10,9 jours au sein du groupe de soins habituels et 10,2 au sein du groupe d'intervention; p non significatif). Le taux brut de mortalit\'e \'etait de 6,2\% et 5,5\% au sein des groupes de soins habituels et d'intervention, respectivement, sans diff\'erence significative (p=0,15) de survie globale. L'analyse ult\'erieure laisse supposer que lorsque l'\'equipe de l'\'etude a pris de l'exp\'erience, les jours d'hospitalisation par patient ont diminu\'e (11,1{$\pm$}0,91 et 8,9{$\pm$}0,61 dans les groupes de soins habituels et d'intervention, respectivement; p{$<$}0,05). Conclusions Le programme d'intervention n'am\'eliorait pas les issues dans la pr\'esente \'etude. L'une des explications de ces r\'esultats, c'est l'observance presque optimale des lignes directrices au sein des deux groupes. Il est \'egalement possible qu'une courbe d'apprentissage importante du personnel soit entr\'ee en ligne de compte, telle que le laisse supposer la r\'eduction des jours totaux d'hospitalisation chez les patients du groupe d'intervention pendant la deuxi\`eme partie de l'\'etude.},

  abstract = {Background: In clinical practice, persistence with statin therapy is poor. While little is known about relative persistence to specific statins, previous studies have observed greater persistence in patients who achieve greater degrees of lipid lowering. Identification of statin therapies which improve patient persistence has the potential to improve the quality of patient care and clinical outcomes. Therefore, we assessed patient persistence with atorvastatin and simvastatin in primary and secondary prevention patients enrolled in managed care.Methods: New statin users aged {$\geq$}18 years, both with and without prior cardiovascular (CV) events within the 12 month pre-treatment period, were identified from a large national database of managed care patients. Patients initiated atorvastatin or simvastatin therapy from January 1, 2003 to September 30, 2005 and were continuously enrolled in a covered plan for at least 12 months before and after initiation of statin therapy. Subanalyses of patients {$\geq$}65 years were also conducted. Measures of interest included demographic and clinical characteristics of the study samples and persistence of statin utilization over the 1-year follow-up period. Persistence was defined as the number of days a patient remained on treatment in the first year following their index date, measured from the date of first fill to study end or the date of discontinuation.Results: A total of 129 764 atorvastatin users and 45 558 simvastatin users without prior CV events were included in the study. For those patients with prior CV events, a total of 6888 atorvastatin users and 4443 simvastatin users were included in the study. Median persistence in patients without prior CV events was 50 days longer for patients initiating therapy with atorvastatin than simvastatin (207 vs. 157 days, p {$<$} 0.0001) and after adjusting for confounding factors, those treated with atorvastatin were 15\% less likely to discontinue therapy during the first year than those treated with simvastatin (HR = 0.85; 95\% CI 0.84, 0.86; p {$<$} 0.001). In secondary prevention patients median persistence was 85 days longer in atorvastatin patients than simvastatin patients (266 vs. 181 days, p {$<$} 0.0001) and atorvastatin patients were 22\% less likely to discontinue therapy (HR = 0.78; 95\% CI 0.75, 0.82; p {$<$} 0.001). Persistence was worse in the elderly patients, but the relative difference between atorvastatin and simvastatin was similar to the overall patient population.Conclusions: In patients with and without prior CV disease, persistence is generally poor, even worse in the elderly, but significantly better for atorvastatin patients than simvastatin patients (p {$<$} 0.001). Further studies are required to determine whether this is due to differences in cost, effectiveness, side-effects, or other attributes of the statins.Study limitations: Differences in persistence could be, in part, due to unmeasured confounders although all available variables were adjusted in multivariate analyses. Additionally, the claims database lacks some clinical data such as lipid levels, limiting assessments of statin efficacy, and does not include any reasons for discontinuation of therapy.},

  abstract = {\textbullet{} This report of an expert panel of the National Cholesterol Education Program provides new guidelines for the treatment of high blood cholesterol in adults 20 years of age and over. Total cholesterol levels are classified as follows: \&lt;200 mg/dL \textemdash "desirable blood cholesterol"; 200 to 239 mg/dL\textemdash borderline\textemdash high blood cholesterol; {$\geq$}240 mg/dL\textemdash high blood cholesterol. The guidelines detail which patients should go on to have lipoprotein analysis, and which should receive cholesterol-lowering treatment on the basis of their low density lipoprotein (LDL)\textemdash cholesterol levels and status with respect to other coronary heart disease risk factors. Dietary therapy is the primary cholesterol-lowering treatment. The report specifies the LDL-cholesterol levels at which dietary therapy should be started and the goals of therapy, and provides detailed guidance on the nature of the recommended dietary changes. If, after six months of intensive dietary therapy, LDL-cholesterol exceeds specified levels, drug treatment should be considered.(Arch Intern Med 1988;148:36-69)},

We aimed to develop, and apply in example countries, a risk prediction equation for cardiovascular disease (consisting here of coronary heart disease and stroke) that can be recalibrated and updated for application in different countries with routinely available information. Methods We used data from eight prospective cohort studies to estimate coefficients of the risk equation with proportional hazard regressions. The risk prediction equation included smoking, blood pressure, diabetes, and total cholesterol, and allowed the effects of sex and age on cardiovascular disease to vary between cohorts or countries. We developed risk equations for fatal cardiovascular disease and for fatal plus non-fatal cardiovascular disease. We validated the risk equations internally and also using data from three cohorts that were not used to create the equations. We then used the risk prediction equation and data from recent (2006 or later) national health surveys to estimate the proportion of the population at different levels of cardiovascular disease risk in 11 countries from different world regions (China, Czech Republic, Denmark, England, Iran, Japan, Malawi, Mexico, South Korea, Spain, and USA). Findings The risk score discriminated well in internal and external validations, with C statistics generally 70\% or more. At any age and risk factor level, the estimated 10 year fatal cardiovascular disease risk varied substantially between countries. The prevalence of people at high risk of fatal cardiovascular disease was lowest in South Korea, Spain, and Denmark, where only 5\textendash 10\% of men and women had more than a 10\% risk, and 62\textendash 76\% of men and 79\textendash 82\% of women had less than a 3\% risk. Conversely, the proportion of people at high risk of fatal cardiovascular disease was largest in China and Mexico. In China, 33\% of men and 28\% of women had a 10-year risk of fatal cardiovascular disease of 10\% or more, whereas in Mexico, the prevalence of this high risk was 15\% for men and 11\% for women. The prevalence of less than a 3\% risk was 37\% for men and 42\% for women in China, and 54\% for men and 68\% for women in Mexico. Interpretation We developed a cardiovascular disease risk equation that can be recalibrated for application in different countries with routinely available information. The estimated percentage of people at high risk of fatal cardiovascular disease was higher in low-income and middle-income countries than in high-income countries.

  abstract = {The objective of this prospective cohort study was to describe real-life use of lipid-lowering drugs and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target-attainment rates 1 year after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). LDL-C was recorded at hospital admission for AMI and at follow-up at 2 and 12 months after AMI in 17,236 patients in the Swedish heart registry, SWEDEHEART, from 2004 through 2009. Lipid-lowering treatments were identified using the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. More than 90\% of patients received statins after AMI. Simvastatin {$\leq$}40~mg was used by 80\% of patients at discharge and at 2 months and 68\% at 1 year after AMI. Intensive statin therapy (LDL-C-lowering capacity {$>$}40\%) was prescribed for 8.4\%, 11.9\%, and 12.2\% at these time points, and combinations of statin/ezetimibe for 1.1\%, 2.8\%, and 5.0\%, respectively. The LDL-C target of {$<$}2.5~mmol/L (97~mg/dl) was achieved in 74.5\% of patients at 2 months and 72.3\% at 12 months after AMI. Treatment was intensified for only 21.3\% of patients with LDL-C above target at 2 months. In multivariate analysis, higher LDL-C levels at admission and at 2 months correlated to increased risk for under treatment at 12 months after AMI. In conclusion, statin treatment after AMI in Sweden has become standard, but titration to reach recommended LDL-C levels is still suboptimal. Strategies to further improve implementation of guidelines are needed.},

It also indicates the desirable range (Table 1), the initiation levels of management (Table 2) and the target levels of treatment (Table 2) for total and LDL-cholesterol.2) Though both total and LDL-cholesterol are shown as atherogenic parameter in the guideline, the use of LDL-cholesterol, rather than total cholesterol, is encouraged in daily medical practice and lipid-related studies, because LDL-cholesterol is more closely related to atherosclerosis.3) Elevated triglycerides and low HDL-cholesterol are included in the risk factors, since no sufficient data have been accumulated to formulate the guideline for these two lipid disorders.4) Emphasis is laid on evaluation of risk factors of each subject before starting any kind of treatment (Table 2).5) This guideline is applied solely for adults (age 20-64). Lipid abnormalities in children or the youth under age 19, and the elderly with an age over 65 have to be evaluated by their own standard.6) This part of the guideline gives only the diagnostic aspects of hyperlipidemias. The part of management and treatment will follow in the second section of the guideline that will be published in future.},

  abstract = {Background WHO has targeted that medicines to prevent recurrent cardiovascular disease be available in 80\% of communities and used by 50\% of eligible individuals by 2025. We have previously reported that use of these medicines is very low, but now aim to assess how such low use relates to their lack of availability or poor affordability. Methods We analysed information about availability and costs of cardiovascular disease medicines (aspirin, {$\beta$} blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins) in pharmacies gathered from 596 communities in 18 countries participating in the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study. Medicines were considered available if present at the pharmacy when surveyed, and affordable if their combined cost was less than 20\% of household capacity-to-pay. We compared results from high-income, upper middle-income, lower middle-income, and low-income countries. Data from India were presented separately given its large, generic pharmaceutical industry. Findings Communities were recruited between Jan 1, 2003, and Dec 31, 2013. All four cardiovascular disease medicines were available in 61 (95\%) of 64 urban and 27 (90\%) of 30 rural communities in high-income countries, 53 (80\%) of 66 urban and 43 (73\%) of 59 rural communities in upper middle-income countries, 69 (62\%) of 111 urban and 42 (37\%) of 114 rural communities in lower middle-income countries, eight (25\%) of 32 urban and one (3\%) of 30 rural communities in low-income countries (excluding India), and 34 (89\%) of 38 urban and 42 (81\%) of 52 rural communities in India. The four cardiovascular disease medicines were potentially unaffordable for 0{$\cdot$}14\% of households in high-income countries (14 of 9934 households), 25\% of upper middle-income countries (6299 of 24\hphantom{,}776), 33\% of lower middle-income countries (13\hphantom{,}253 of 40\hphantom{,}023), 60\% of low-income countries (excluding India; 1976 of 3312), and 59\% households in India (9939 of 16\hphantom{,}874). In low-income and middle-income countries, patients with previous cardiovascular disease were less likely to use all four medicines if fewer than four were available (odds ratio [OR] 0{$\cdot$}16, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}04\textendash 0{$\cdot$}57). In communities in which all four medicines were available, patients were less likely to use medicines if the household potentially could not afford them (0{$\cdot$}16, 0{$\cdot$}04\textendash 0{$\cdot$}55). Interpretation Secondary prevention medicines are unavailable and unaffordable for a large proportion of communities and households in upper middle-income, lower middle-income, and low-income countries, which have very low use of these medicines. Improvements to the availability and affordability of key medicines is likely to enhance their use and help towards achieving WHO's targets of 50\% use of key medicines by 2025.

Methods A total of 2,442 CHD patients with hyperlipidemia were randomized to either an aggressive treatment arm using atorvastatin or usual care and followed for 51.5 months on average. Atorvastatin-group patients were titrated to LDL-C goals of \&lt;80 mg/dl (2.1 mmol/l) or a maximum atorvastatin dose of 80 mg/day. Usual-care patients received any treatment deemed appropriate by their regular physicians. End point assessments were complete in 958 atorvastatin-group and 941 usual-care patients. Partial assessments occurred in 259 patients in the atorvastatin group and 284 patients in the usual care group who did not complete four years of study participation because of adverse events, withdrawn consent, or follow-up loss. The primary efficacy parameter was time to first cardiovascular event. Results A total of 289 (23.7\%) patients in the atorvastatin group compared with 333 (27.7\%) patients in the usual care group experienced a primary outcome (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95\% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.97, p = 0.02). This reduction in morbidity was largely due to fewer non-fatal myocardial infarctions (4.3\% vs. 7.7\%, p = 0.0002). Levels of LDL-C were reduced more (34.3\% vs. 23.3\%, p \&lt; 0.0001) and National Cholesterol Education Program goals (LDL-C \&lt;100 mg/dl) more likely met at end-of-study visits (72.4\% vs. 40.0\%) in patients receiving atorvastatin compared with those receiving usual care. Conclusions An aggressive, focused statin therapy management strategy outperformed usual care in health maintenance organization and Veterans Administration clinic patients with CHD.},

  abstract = {Objective: To estimate by how much and how quickly a given reduction in serum cholesterol concentration will reduce the risk of ischaemic heart disease. Design: Data on the incidence of ischaemic heart disease and serum cholesterol concentration were analysed from 10 prospective (cohort) studies, three international studies in different communities, and 28 randomised controlled trials (with mortality data analysed according to allocated treatment to ensure the avoidance of bias). Main outcome measure - Decrease in incidence of ischaemic heart disease or mortality for a 0.6 mmol/l (about 10\%) decrease in serum cholesterol concentration. Results: For men results from the cohort studies showed that a decrease of serum cholesterol concentration of 0.6 mmol/l (about 10\%) was associated with a decrease in incidence of ischaemic heart disease of 54\% at age 40 years, 39\% at age 50, 27\% at 60, 20\% at 70, and 19\% at 80. The combined estimate from the three international studies (for ages 55-64 years) was 38\% (95\% confidence interval 33\% to 42\%), somewhat greater than the cohort study estimate of 27\%. The reductions in incidence of ischaemic heart disease in the randomised trials (for ages 55-64 years) were 7\% (0 to 14\%) in the first two years, 22\% (15\% to 28\%) from 2.1-5 years, and 25\% (15\% to 35\%) after five years, the last estimate being lose to the estimate of 27\% for the long term reduction from the cohort studies. The data for women are limited but indicate a similar effect. Conclusions - The results from the cohort studies, international comparisons, and clinical trials are remarkably consistent. The cohort studies, based on half a million men and 18 000 ischaemic heart disease events, estimate that a long term reduction in serum cholesterol concentration of 0.6 mmol/l (10\%), which can be achieved by moderate dietary change,lowers the risk of ischaemic heart disease by 50\% at age 40, falling to 20\% at age 70. The randomised trials, based on 45 000 men and 4000 ischaemic heart disease events show that the full effect of the reduction in risk is achieved by five years.},

  abstract = {Background As the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia is increasing in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), detailed evidence is urgently needed to guide the response of health systems to this epidemic. This study sought to quantify unmet need for hypercholesterolemia care among adults in 35 LMICs. Methods and findings We pooled individual-level data from 129,040 respondents aged 15 years and older from 35 nationally representative surveys conducted between 2009 and 2018. Hypercholesterolemia care was quantified using cascade of care analyses in the pooled sample and by region, country income group, and country. Hypercholesterolemia was defined as (i) total cholesterol (TC) {$\geq$}240 mg/dL or self-reported lipid-lowering medication use and, alternatively, as (ii) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) {$\geq$}160 mg/dL or self-reported lipid-lowering medication use. Stages of the care cascade for hypercholesterolemia were defined as follows: screened (prior to the survey), aware of diagnosis, treated (lifestyle advice and/or medication), and controlled (TC {$<$}200 mg/dL or LDL-C {$<$}130 mg/dL). We further estimated how age, sex, education, body mass index (BMI), current smoking, having diabetes, and having hypertension are associated with cascade progression using modified Poisson regression models with survey fixed effects. High TC prevalence was 7.1\% (95\% CI: 6.8\% to 7.4\%), and high LDL-C prevalence was 7.5\% (95\% CI: 7.1\% to 7.9\%). The cascade analysis showed that 43\% (95\% CI: 40\% to 45\%) of study participants with high TC and 47\% (95\% CI: 44\% to 50\%) with high LDL-C ever had their cholesterol measured prior to the survey. About 31\% (95\% CI: 29\% to 33\%) and 36\% (95\% CI: 33\% to 38\%) were aware of their diagnosis; 29\% (95\% CI: 28\% to 31\%) and 33\% (95\% CI: 31\% to 36\%) were treated; 7\% (95\% CI: 6\% to 9\%) and 19\% (95\% CI: 18\% to 21\%) were controlled. We found substantial heterogeneity in cascade performance across countries and higher performances in upper-middle-income countries and the Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, and Americas. Lipid screening was significantly associated with older age, female sex, higher education, higher BMI, comorbid diagnosis of diabetes, and comorbid diagnosis of hypertension. Awareness of diagnosis was significantly associated with older age, higher BMI, comorbid diagnosis of diabetes, and comorbid diagnosis of hypertension. Lastly, treatment of hypercholesterolemia was significantly associated with comorbid hypertension and diabetes, and control of lipid measures with comorbid diabetes. The main limitations of this study are a potential recall bias in self-reported information on received health services as well as diminished comparability due to varying survey years and varying lipid guideline application across country and clinical settings. Conclusions Cascade performance was poor across all stages, indicating large unmet need for hypercholesterolemia care in this sample of LMICs\textemdash calling for greater policy and research attention toward this cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor and highlighting opportunities for improved prevention of CVD.},

  abstract = {Background In the prevention of cardiovascular disease, a WHO target is that at least 50\% of eligible people use statins. Robust evidence is needed to monitor progress towards this target in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), where most cardiovascular disease deaths occur. The objectives of this study were to benchmark statin use in LMICs and to investigate country-level and individual-level characteristics associated with statin use. Methods We did a cross-sectional analysis of pooled, individual-level data from nationally representative health surveys done in 41 LMICs between 2013 and 2019. Our sample consisted of non-pregnant adults aged 40\textendash 69 years. We prioritised WHO Stepwise Approach to Surveillance (STEPS) surveys because these are WHO's recommended method for population monitoring of non-communicable disease targets. For countries in which no STEPS survey was available, a systematic search was done to identify other surveys. We included surveys that were done in an LMIC as classified by the World Bank in the survey year; were done in 2013 or later; were nationally representative; had individual-level data available; and asked questions on statin use and previous history of cardiovascular disease. Primary outcomes were the proportion of eligible individuals self-reporting use of statins for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Eligibility for statin therapy for primary prevention was defined among individuals with a history of diagnosed diabetes or a 10-year cardiovascular disease risk of at least 20\%. Eligibility for statin therapy for secondary prevention was defined among individuals with a history of self-reported cardiovascular disease. At the country level, we estimated statin use by per-capita health spending, per-capita income, burden of cardiovascular diseases, and commitment to non-communicable disease policy. At the individual level, we used modified Poisson regression models to assess statin use alongside individual-level characteristics of age, sex, education, and rural versus urban residence. Countries were weighted in proportion to their population size in pooled analyses. Findings The final pooled sample included 116\hphantom{,}449 non-pregnant individuals. 9229 individuals reported a previous history of cardiovascular disease (7{$\cdot$}9\% [95\% CI 7{$\cdot$}4\textendash 8{$\cdot$}3] of the population-weighted sample). Among those without a previous history of cardiovascular disease, 8453 were eligible for a statin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (9{$\cdot$}7\% [95\% CI 9{$\cdot$}3\textendash 10{$\cdot$}1] of the population-weighted sample). For primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, statin use was 8{$\cdot$}0\% (95\% CI 6{$\cdot$}9\textendash 9{$\cdot$}3) and for secondary prevention statin use was 21{$\cdot$}9\% (20{$\cdot$}0\textendash 24{$\cdot$}0). The WHO target that at least 50\% of eligible individuals receive statin therapy to prevent cardiovascular disease was achieved by no region or income group. Statin use was less common in countries with lower health spending. At the individual level, there was generally higher statin use among women (primary prevention only, risk ratio [RR] 1{$\cdot$}83 [95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}22\textendash 2{$\cdot$}76), and individuals who were older (primary prevention, 60\textendash 69 years, RR 1{$\cdot$}86 [1{$\cdot$}04\textendash 3{$\cdot$}33]; secondary prevention, 50\textendash 59 years RR 1{$\cdot$}71 [1{$\cdot$}35\textendash 2{$\cdot$}18]; and 60\textendash 69 years RR 2{$\cdot$}09 [1{$\cdot$}65\textendash 2{$\cdot$}65]), more educated (primary prevention, RR 1{$\cdot$}61 [1{$\cdot$}09\textendash 2{$\cdot$}37]; secondary prevention, RR 1{$\cdot$}28 [0{$\cdot$}97\textendash 1{$\cdot$}69]), and lived in urban areas (secondary prevention only, RR 0{$\cdot$}82 [0{$\cdot$}66\textendash 1{$\cdot$}00]). Interpretation In a diverse sample of LMICs, statins are used by about one in ten eligible people for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases and one in five eligible people for secondary prevention. There is an urgent need to scale up statin use in LMICs to achieve WHO targets. Policies and programmes that facilitate implementation of statins into primary health systems in these settings should be investigated for the future.

Design Interrupted time series analysis of prospectively collected electronic data from primary care. Setting Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) in the United Kingdom. Participants Patients newly eligible for or currently taking statins for primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention in each month in January 2011-March 2015. Main outcome measures Adjusted odds ratios for starting/stopping taking statins after the media coverage (October 2013-March 2014). Results There was no evidence that the period of high media coverage was associated with changes in statin initiation among patients with a high recorded risk score for cardiovascular disease (primary prevention) or a recent cardiovascular event (secondary prevention) (odds ratio 0.99 (95\% confidence interval 0.87 to 1.13; P=0.92) and 1.04 (0.92 to 1.18; P=0.54), respectively), though there was a decrease in the overall proportion of patients with a recorded risk score. Patients already taking statins were more likely to stop taking them for both primary and secondary prevention after the high media coverage period (1.11 (1.05 to 1.18; P{$<$}0.001) and 1.12 (1.04 to 1.21; P=0.003), respectively). Stratified analyses showed that older patients and those with a longer continuous prescription were more likely to stop taking statins after the media coverage. In post hoc analyses, the increased rates of cessation were no longer observed after six months. Conclusions A period of intense public discussion over the risks:benefit balance of statins, covered widely in the media, was followed by a transient rise in the proportion of people who stopped taking statins. This research highlights the potential for widely covered health stories in the lay media to impact on healthcare related behaviour.},

  abstract = {Marked increases in the awareness, treatment, and control of high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol occurred among United States (US) adults from 1988\textendash 1994 to 1999\textendash 2004. An update to the Third Adult Treatment Panel guidelines was published in 2004, and it is unknown if these improvements have continued since the publication of these revised treatment recommendations. The aim of this study was to determine trends in the awareness, treatment, and control of high LDL cholesterol among US adults from 1999\textendash 2000 to 2009\textendash 2010 using nationally representative samples of US adults aged {$\geq$}20 years from 6 consecutive National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) in 1999\textendash 2000 (n~=~1,659), 2001\textendash 2002 (n~= 1,897), 2003\textendash 2004 (n~=~1,698), 2005\textendash 2006 (n~= 1,692), 2007\textendash 2008 (n~=~2,044), and~2009\textendash 2010~(n~= 2,318). LDL cholesterol was measured after an overnight fast, and high LDL cholesterol and controlled LDL cholesterol were defined using the 2004 updated Third Adult Treatment Panel guidelines. Awareness and treatment of high cholesterol were defined using self-report. Among US adults, the prevalence of high LDL cholesterol did not change from 1999\textendash 2000 (37.2\%) to 2009\textendash 2010 (37.8\%). Awareness of high LDL cholesterol increased from 48.9\% in 1999\textendash 2000 to 62.8\% in 2003\textendash 2004 but did not increase further through 2009\textendash 2010 (61.5\%). Among those aware of having high LDL cholesterol, treatment increased from 41.3\% in 1999\textendash 2000 to 72.6\% in 2007\textendash 2008 and was 70.0\% in 2009\textendash 2010. Among US adults receiving treatment for high LDL cholesterol, the percentage with controlled LDL cholesterol increased from 45.0\% in 1999\textendash 2000 to 65.3\% in 2005\textendash 2006 and had decreased slightly by 2009\textendash 2010 (63.6\%). In~conclusion, high LDL cholesterol remains common among US adults.

  abstract = {Marked increases in the awareness, treatment, and control of high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol occurred among United States (US) adults from 1988\textendash 1994 to 1999\textendash 2004. An update to the Third Adult Treatment Panel guidelines was published in 2004, and it is unknown if these improvements have continued since the publication of these revised treatment recommendations. The aim of this study was to determine trends in the awareness, treatment, and control of high LDL cholesterol among US adults from 1999\textendash 2000 to 2009\textendash 2010 using nationally representative samples of US adults aged {$\geq$}20 years from 6 consecutive National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) in 1999\textendash 2000 (n~=~1,659), 2001\textendash 2002 (n~= 1,897), 2003\textendash 2004 (n~=~1,698), 2005\textendash 2006 (n~= 1,692), 2007\textendash 2008 (n~=~2,044), and~2009\textendash 2010~(n~= 2,318). LDL cholesterol was measured after an overnight fast, and high LDL cholesterol and controlled LDL cholesterol were defined using the 2004 updated Third Adult Treatment Panel guidelines. Awareness and treatment of high cholesterol were defined using self-report. Among US adults, the prevalence of high LDL cholesterol did not change from 1999\textendash 2000 (37.2\%) to 2009\textendash 2010 (37.8\%). Awareness of high LDL cholesterol increased from 48.9\% in 1999\textendash 2000 to 62.8\% in 2003\textendash 2004 but did not increase further through 2009\textendash 2010 (61.5\%). Among those aware of having high LDL cholesterol, treatment increased from 41.3\% in 1999\textendash 2000 to 72.6\% in 2007\textendash 2008 and was 70.0\% in 2009\textendash 2010. Among US adults receiving treatment for high LDL cholesterol, the percentage with controlled LDL cholesterol increased from 45.0\% in 1999\textendash 2000 to 65.3\% in 2005\textendash 2006 and had decreased slightly by 2009\textendash 2010 (63.6\%). In~conclusion, high LDL cholesterol remains common among US adults. Additional efforts are needed to prevent high LDL cholesterol and increase the awareness, treatment, and control of high LDL cholesterol among US adults.},

  abstract = {This dietary guidance, informed by best contemporary evidence, aims to assist medical practitioners and allied health professionals in advising patients for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). While differing in some details from other current guidelines, the core messages accord with those published in 2019 by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society; the National Lipid Association in 2014 and the NH\&MRC Australian Dietary Guidelines in 2013. These were assessed through the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) and the levels of evidence and classes of a recommendation developed using the GRADE system. Recommendations with high levels of evidence include increased consumption of plant based foods comprising mainly complex, fibre enriched carbohydrates (wholegrains, fruits and vegetables) while limiting intake of refined starches; partial replacement of saturated fats with monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fats and oils; reduced salt intake; achievement and maintenance of healthy weight; and low-to-moderate consumption of alcohol. Additional guidance but with moderate levels of evidence includes increased consumption of fish (and fish oils where indicated); reduction in sugar-sweetened beverages and added sugars; avoidance of butter and cream especially in those at increased CVD risk but encouragement of yoghurt; allow moderate consumption of lean meat but limit intake of processed meats; and limit cholesterol-rich foods such as eggs and crustaceans for those at increased CVD risk. Guidance has been formulated qualitatively on food categories of commonly eaten foods while avoiding prescriptive quantitative measures that are less readily translatable. This approach accords with current guidelines such as the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2019 guidelines and is understandable and readily implemented. Under ``treat to risk'' goals, low-density (LDL)-cholesterol follow-up measurements monitor statin compliance rather than titration to target levels, however, there is little evidence showing that more-frequent monitoring reduces LDL-cholesterol. We therefore tested whether frequency of blood tests significantly predicted lipoprotein improvements in a large anonymized clinical laboratory database. Differences ({$\increment$} {$\pm$} SE) in total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-cholesterol between baseline and follow-up visits were calculated for 97,548 men and 110,424 women whose physicians sent blood to Boston Heart Diagnostics for analysis between 2010 and 2017. When adjusted for age and follow-up duration, plasma concentration changes per each follow-up measurement in men and women respectively were -2.84 {$\pm$} 0.10 mg/dL and -3.03 {$\pm$} 0.10 mg/dL for total cholesterol, -3.78 {$\pm$} 0.30 mg/dL and -2.26 {$\pm$} 0.19 mg/dL for triglycerides, and -2.54 {$\pm$} 0.09 mg/dL and -3.06 {$\pm$} 0.09 mg/dL for LDL-cholesterol (all P {$<$} 10-16). Relative to baseline, significant decreases (P {$<$} 10-16) were observed for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd follow-up measurements for total cholesterol (mean {$\pm$} SE, men: -9.4 {$\pm$} 0.1, -11.9 {$\pm$} 0.2, -13.7 {$\pm$} 0.3; women: -8.0 {$\pm$} 0.1, -10.5 {$\pm$} 0.2, -12.6 {$\pm$} 0.3 mg/dL, respectively), triglycerides (men: -10.3 {$\pm$} 0.4, -12.8 {$\pm$} 0.5, -13.4 {$\pm$} 0.7; women: -6.4 {$\pm$} 0.2, -8.8 {$\pm$} 0.4, -10.1 {$\pm$} 0.5 mg/dL, respectively) and LDL-cholesterol (men: -7.8 {$\pm$} 0.1, -9.9 {$\pm$} 0.2, -11.1 {$\pm$} 0.2; women: -6.9 {$\pm$} 0.1, -9.0 {$\pm$} 0.2, -10.7 {$\pm$} 0.2 mg/dL, respectively). When adjusted for regression to the mean, 6.9\%, 9.9\% and 11.8\% of men, and 5.7\%, 9.7\% and 11.5\% of women, went from having an LDL-cholesterol {$\geq$}160 to {$<$}160 mg/dL for their 1st, 2nd, and 3rd follow-up measurements, respectively. We conclude that under usual physician care, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL-cholesterol concentrations decreased progressively with increased physician monitoring within a large patient population. The higher serum adiponectin concentrations observed in females are often attributed to differences in adiposity or sex hormones. There is little data describing adiponectin in Indigenous Australians, and no studies examining its association with cardio-metabolic disease risk markers and chronic kidney disease (CKD). To describe the relationship of serum adiponectin with cardio-metabolic disease risk markers and kidney function in a community-based sample of Indigenous Australian adults, with particular reference to sex-specific differences. A cross-sectional analysis of a community-based volunteer sample of 548 Indigenous Australian adults (62\% female), stratified into five cardio-metabolic risk groups ranging from good health (strata-1) to high cardio-metabolic risk and low measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR, {$<$}60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (strata-5). We examined serum adiponectin concentrations with cardio-metabolic risk markers, albuminuria and mGFR. Indigenous Australian females had a lower than expected adiponectin concentration (3.5 {$\mu$}g/ml), which was higher than males in strata 1\textendash 4 (as in other populations), but not in strata-5 (mGFR {$<$} 60, p = 0.19), and higher leptin: adiponectin ratio than other populations (7.8 ng/{$\mu$}g \textendash{} strata-1, healthy females; 12.2 ng/{$\mu$}g \textendash{} strata-3, females with diabetes and mGFR {$\geq$} 90). Female-gender, HDL-cholesterol (positive), mGFR and waist: hip ratio (WHR) (inverse) were independently associated with log-adiponectin when mGFR {$\geq$} 60; when mGFR {$<$} 60, female-gender was associated with 0.27 units lower log-adiponectin. Female-gender was not associated with higher adiponectin concentrations in Indigenous Australians with mGFR {$<$} 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. High WHR was frequent in both genders, and inversely associated with adiponectin. Longitudinal studies are needed to examine relationships of serum adiponectin, obesity and cardiovascular disease events in Indigenous Australians. Management of hyperlipidaemia remains a cornerstone therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Dietary supplementation with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) has been shown to modulate blood lipid profiles and reduce the risk of developing CVD. However, studies relating objective measures of long-term dietary n-3 PUFA intake and circulating lipid levels in older adults are limited. Thus, we aimed to determine whether there is an association between erythrocyte n-3 PUFA status (omega-3 index, O3I) and blood lipid profiles in older adults. A sample of adults aged 65\textendash 95 years who participated in the Retirement Health and Lifestyle Study was evaluated. Outcome measures included O3I (\% eicosapentaenoic acid+\% docosahexaenoic acid) and fasting blood lipid profiles [total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and triglyceride (TG)]. Two hundred and seventy-six subjects were included in the analyses. The mean{$\pm$}SD age was 77.6{$\pm$}7.4 years, and 40.9\% were males. O3I was significantly higher in females compared to males. O3I was inversely associated with plasma TG (P{$<$}.001) and TC/HDL-cholesterol ratio (P{$<$}.05), and positively associated with HDL-cholesterol (P{$<$}.05), in all subjects. Associations between O3I and TG were evident in both females (r=-0.250, P{$<$}.01) and males (r=-0.225, P{$<$}.05). In females only, the odds of being hypertriglyceridaemic were highest in those with lowest O3I (P=.006). Trends for hypercholesterolaemia and elevated LDL risk were converse between males and females. Long-term n-3 PUFA status is associated with blood lipid profiles in older Australians. Our findings support the development and implementation of age-specific dietary strategies to reduce the risk of CVD via improving the O3I. The primary aim was to describe characteristics of men identified at high-risk for Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) using the Australian diabetes risk assessment (AUSDRISK) tool. Secondary aims were to determine the prevalence of pre-diabetes and metabolic syndrome in these men. Men (n = 209) completed the AUSDRISK tool, with 165 identified as high-risk for T2DM (score {$\geq$} 12, maximum 38). Demographic, anthropometric, physiological and behavioural outcomes were assessed for 101 men. Comparisons (one-way ANOVA) among three AUSDRISK score groups (12\textendash 15, 16\textendash 19, {$\geq$} 20) were performed (significance level, P {$<$} 0.05). Common risk factors (percentages) among high-risk men were waist circumference ({$>$} 90 cm; 93\%), age ({$>$} 44 years; 79\%), physical activity level ({$<$} 150 min wk-1; 59\%), family history of diabetes (39\%) and previously high blood glucose levels (32\%). Men with AUSDRISK scores {$\geq$} 20 had higher (mean {$\pm$} SD) HbA1C (6.0 {$\pm$} 0.4\% [42 {$\pm$} 4.4 mmol.mol-1], P {$<$} 0.001), FPG (5.3 {$\pm$} 0.6 mmol.L-1, P = 0.001) and waist circumference (113.2 {$\pm$} 9.8 cm, P = 0.026) than men with scores of 12\textendash 15. Mean FPG for the sample was 5.0 {$\pm$} 0.6 mmol.L-1, whereas mean HbA1C was 5.8 {$\pm$} 0.5\% [40 {$\pm$} 5.5 mmol.mol-1]. Pre-diabetes prevalence was 70\% and metabolic syndrome prevalence was 62\%. The AUSDRISK tool identified men who were mostly older than 44, and had large waist circumferences and elevated HbA1C. These findings provide evidence supporting the usefulness of the AUSDRISK screening tool for T2DM screening in clinical and research settings. Large reductions in cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality have been achieved over the last 50 years in developed countries. The health policies that have contributed so much to this success have largely been coordinated by means of expert guidelines for the management of the classic modifiable risk factors such as blood pressure, diabetes and blood lipids. National and international guidelines for lipid management have demonstrated a high degree of consistency between numerous sets of recommendations. It has been argued that some important components of the consensus that has been established over the past decade have been challenged by the latest guidelines of the American Heart Association - American College of Cardiologists (AHA-ACC). Clinicians can be reassured that continued reliance on extensive scientific evidence has reaffirmed the importance of lipid metabolism as a modifiable risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, the recent AHA-ACC guidelines suggest changes in the strategies by which metabolic risk factors may be modified. This small number of important changes should not be sensationalised because these differences usefully reflect the need for guidelines to evolve to accommodate different contexts and changing perspectives as well as emerging issues and new information for which clinical trial evidence is incomplete. This article will consider the recent policies and responses of national and supranational organisations on topics including components of CVD risk assessment, sources of CVD risk information and re-appraisal of lipid-lowering interventions. Timely review of Australian lipid management guidelines will require consideration of these issues because they are creating a new context within which new guidelines must evolve.},

Our aim was to compare trends in total, HDL and non-HDL cholesterol and the total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio in Asian and Western countries.We pooled 458 population-based studies with 82.1\,million participants in 23 Asian and Western countries. We estimated changes in mean total, HDL and non-HDL cholesterol and mean total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio by country, sex and age group.Since {$\sim$}1980, mean TC increased in Asian countries. In Japan and South Korea, the TC rise was due to rising HDL cholesterol, which increased by up to 0.17\,mmol/L per decade in Japanese women; in China, it was due to rising non-HDL cholesterol. TC declined in Western countries, except in Polish men. The decline was largest in Finland and Norway, at {$\sim$}0.4\,mmol/L per decade. The decline in TC in most Western countries was the net effect of an increase in HDL cholesterol and a decline in non-HDL cholesterol, with the HDL cholesterol increase largest in New Zealand and Switzerland. Mean total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio declined in Japan, South Korea and most Western countries, by as much as {$\sim$}0.7 per decade in Swiss men (equivalent to {$\sim$}26\% decline in coronary heart disease risk per decade). The ratio increased in China.HDL cholesterol has risen and the total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio has declined in many Western countries, Japan and South Korea, with only a weak correlation with changes in TC or non-HDL cholesterol.},

  abstract = {Background Age, sex, and blood pressure could modify the associations of total cholesterol (and its main two fractions, HDL and LDL cholesterol) with vascular mortality. This meta-analysis combined prospective studies of vascular mortality that recorded both blood pressure and total cholesterol at baseline, to determine the joint relevance of these two risk factors. Methods Information was obtained from 61 prospective observational studies, mostly in western Europe or North America, consisting of almost 900\hphantom{,}000 adults without previous disease and with baseline measurements of total cholesterol and blood pressure. During nearly 12 million person years at risk between the ages of 40 and 89 years, there were more than 55\hphantom{,}000 vascular deaths (34\hphantom{,}000 ischaemic heart disease [IHD], 12\hphantom{,}000 stroke, 10\hphantom{,}000 other). Information about HDL cholesterol was available for 150\hphantom{,}000 participants, among whom there were 5000 vascular deaths (3000 IHD, 1000 stroke, 1000 other). Reported associations are with usual cholesterol levels (ie, corrected for the regression dilution bias). Findings 1 mmol/L lower total cholesterol was associated with about a half (hazard ratio 0{$\cdot$}44 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}42\textendash 0{$\cdot$}48]), a third (0{$\cdot$}66 [0{$\cdot$}65\textendash 0{$\cdot$}68]), and a sixth (0{$\cdot$}83 [0{$\cdot$}81\textendash 0{$\cdot$}85]) lower IHD mortality in both sexes at ages 40\textendash 49, 50\textendash 69, and 70\textendash 89 years, respectively, throughout the main range of cholesterol in most developed countries, with no apparent threshold. The proportional risk reduction decreased with increasing blood pressure, since the absolute effects of cholesterol and blood pressure were approximately additive. Of various simple indices involving HDL cholesterol, the ratio total/HDL cholesterol was the strongest predictor of IHD mortality (40\% more informative than non-HDL cholesterol and more than twice as informative as total cholesterol). Total cholesterol was weakly positively related to ischaemic and total stroke mortality in early middle age (40\textendash 59 years), but this finding could be largely or wholly accounted for by the association of cholesterol with blood pressure. Moreover, a positive relation was seen only in middle age and only in those with below-average blood pressure; at older ages (70\textendash 89 years) and, particularly, for those with systolic blood pressure over about 145 mm\hphantom{,}Hg, total cholesterol was negatively related to haemorrhagic and total stroke mortality. The results for other vascular mortality were intermediate between those for IHD and stroke. Interpretation Total cholesterol was positively associated with IHD mortality in both middle and old age and at all blood pressure levels. The absence of an independent positive association of cholesterol with stroke mortality, especially at older ages or higher blood pressures, is unexplained, and invites further research. Nevertheless, there is conclusive evidence from randomised trials that statins substantially reduce not only coronary event rates but also total stroke rates in patients with a wide range of ages and blood pressures.},

  abstract = {Large prospective studies involving several hundred thousands to several million people from the general population have shown, that people with obesity have a higher overall mortality rate than people with a normal BMI. The use of BMI in predicting the prognosis of people with cardiovascular disease has led to the inverse relationship between BMI and risk of death. Obesity, determined by BMI, is very heterogeneous in determining prognosis in different groups of patients. The use of imaging techniques during the examination revealed that poor health effects are associated with the accumulation of visceral adipose tissue. New evidence also suggests that ectopic deposition of fat (in the liver, in the epicardium) may increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. The number of studies examining the direct effect of visceral adipose tissue on mortality is very limited. Their results are extremely contradictory, based not on prospective observations, but on the construction of statistical models. The above data lead us to the conclusion that it is necessary to create a new classification that would improve the stratification of the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and death in people with obesity. Gum Arabic (GA) is a mixture of polysaccharides and glycoproteins secreted from Acacia senegal, Acacia seyal, and Acacia nilotica trees' stems. The high spot of this chapter was to review the application of GA in human health and medicine. GA has been applied to relieve the opposing effects of chronic renal failure and has a positive effect on nephrotoxicity; raises creatinine clearance from the body; improves renal excretion of ADH, Mg2+, and Ca2+; decreases plasma urea and plasma phosphate, urinary flow rate, phosphaturia, natriuresis, glucosuria, proteinuria as well as urinary excretion of Na+ and phosphate; and it reduces the blood pressure and plasma cholesterol concentrations. It is a good antioxidant, which protects against cardiac and hepatic toxicities. It has pro-absorptive properties, which can be an effective substitute medication for diarrhea. It is effective in dental remineralization. GA has antimicrobial action and is known to be used as an effective prebiotic as good as inulin, which increases the numbers of Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria, and Bacteroides without significant drawbacks. GA has an opposing effect of vitamin D and electrolyte balance, and in some cases, it causes hypersensitivity. hyperlipidemia is one of the most important cardiovascular risk factors. Statins at high doses are commonly prescribed to lower LDL-cholesterol, but are often poorly tolerated. In particular, muscle pain and increase of creatine phosphokinase are frequent side effects. The purpose of this study was to assess whether the addition of a nutraceutical to simvastatin may result in the achievement of the therapeutic target (LDL-cholesterol less than 70 mg/dL) without side effects in patients with ischemic heart disease. Sixty-four patients with ischemic heart disease treated with simvastatin 20 mg who had not achieved the therapeutic target were enrolled. Patients were randomised 1:1. Patients of group A (n = 32) were given simvastatin 40 mg per day and patients of group B (n = 32) were given simvastatin 20 mg plus 2 tablets of a nutraceutical composed of bergamot, phytosterols, artichoke, vitamin C. After 3 months, patients in both groups showed a significant reduction from baseline in total cholesterol, LDL-c and tryglicerides. However, in group A, 4 patients reported myalgia (9,7\%) with an increase in creatine phosphokinase; whereas no adverse events occurred in group B. The association of a nutraceutical and simvastatin 20 mg may be a valid therapeutic option for the treatment of hyperlipidemia in patients with ischemic heart disease intolerant to statin at high doses, in the absence of side effects. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms of action of nutraceuticals. Describir el comportamiento de los factores de riesgo relacionados con la hipertensi\'on arterial, el consumo declarado de medicamentos y el perfil metab\'olico en una poblaci\'on de pacientes valorados en el Servicio de Medicina Interna del Hospital Departamental Felipe Su\'arez de Salamina, Caldas, durante octubre a diciembre de 2012. Se valoraron 400 pacientes hipertensos del servicio de Medicina Interna del Hospital Departamental Felipe Su\'arez, durante octubre a diciembre de 2012. Se aplicaron formatos de registro y se procesaron en forma descriptiva. Se encontr\'o una prevalencia de sedentarismo del 43,7\% y de tabaquismo del 9,3\%. En un 84,3\% de los hipertensos evaluados se encontraron cifras de presi\'on arterial controladas. El 73,3\% ten\'ia pobre control de las cifras de colesterol LDL. Los diur\'eticos fueron el grupo de medicamentos antihipertensivos de mayor consumo (87,2\%). La prevenci\'on y el control de los factores de riesgo cardiovascular deben convertirse en una prioridad, en una pol\'itica p\'ublica saludable del sistema de salud, que impacte a la totalidad de la poblaci\'on, con el fin de disminuir la prevalencia ascendente de los denominados grandes s\'indromes del adulto, responsables de las mayores tasas relacionadas con morbimortalidad en la poblaci\'on general, a trav\'es de la promoci\'on de estilos de vida saludables, realizaci\'on de actividad f\'isica regular y detecci\'on temprana de factores de riesgo. To describe the behavior of risk factors associated with hypertension, reported consumption of drugs and metabolic profile in a population of patients evaluated in the internal medicine department of the Hospital Departamental Felipe Su\'arez of Salamina (in Caldas, Colombia) during the period between October and December 2012. We evaluated 400 patients with hypertension of the internal medicine department of the Hospital Departamental Felipe Su\'arez during the months of October, November and December 2012. Registration forms were applied and processed in descriptive form. We found a prevalence of sedentarism of 43.7\% and smoking of 9.3\%. In 84.3\% of hypertensive patients evaluated we found controlled blood pressure. 73.3\% had poor control of LDL cholesterol levels. The diuretics were the group of anti hypertensive medication with the highest consumption (87.2\%). primary prevention and control of cardiovascular risk factors should be turned into a priority, healthy public policy in the health system, which impacts the entire population, in order to decrease the rising prevalence of so-called large adult syndromes and those which are responsible for the higher rates associated with morbidity and mortality in the general population through promotion of healthy lifestyles, physical activity and early detection of risk factors. Dyslipidaemia is among the most important risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD). The lowering of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) yields significant reduction in both morbidity and mortality rates, particularly in patients with established CHD. The aim of this survey was to assess how dyslipidaemia is managed following a coronary event in different places in Europe. CHD patients' data from centres in 22 European countries were gathered using standardised methods. In total, 8467 CHD patients with lipid measurements in one central laboratory were included. Trends from 8 countries participating in all three EUROASPIRE surveys (1994\textendash 1995, 1999\textendash 2000, 2006\textendash 2007) were also investigated. 51.1\% of CHD patients had elevated total cholesterol ({$\geq$}4.5 mmol/L), 54.5\% had raised LDL-C ({$\geq$}2.5 mmol/L), 36.7\% had low HDL-C ({$<$}1.0 mmol/L for men and {$<$}1.2 mmol/L for women), and 34.7\% had increased triglycerides ({$\geq$}1.7 mmol/L). The use of lipid lowering drugs was 79.8\% but it varied considerably, ranging from only 41.6\% (Lithuania) to 95.4\% (Finland). Over the past decade, in 8 countries the prevalence of hypercholesterolaemia ({$\geq$}4.5 mmol/L) in CHD patients has decreased from 94.5\% in the first to 76.7\% in the second and 46.2\% in the third survey (p {$<$} 0.0001). The use of lipid-lowering drugs increased from 32.3\% in the first, to 62.7\% in the second and 88.8\% in the third survey (p {$<$} 0.0001). Although management of dyslipidaemia in CHD patients is improving, a large majority of CHD patients with dyslipidaemia is still inadequately treated and many patients on lipid-lowering therapy are not reaching the treatment goals. Therefore, a considerable potential still exists throughout Europe to reduce CHD mortality and morbidity rates through better treatment of dyslipidaemia. We report a novel lamin A/C (LMNA) mutation, p.Glu223Lys, in a family with extensive atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus and steatosis hepatis. Sequence analysis of LMNA (using Alamut version 2.2), co-segregation analysis, electron microscopy, extensive phenotypic evaluation of the mutation carriers and literature comparison were used to determine the loss of function of this mutation. The father of three siblings died at the age of 45 years. The three siblings and the brother and sister of the father were referred to the cardiovascular genetics department, because of the premature atherosclerosis and dysmorphic characteristics observed in the father at autopsy. The novel LMNA mutation, p.Glu223Lys, was identified in the proband and his two sons. Clinical evaluation revealed atherosclerosis, insulin resistance and hypertension in the proband and dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis in all the patients with the mutation. Based on the facts that in silico analysis predicts a possibly pathogenic mutation, the mutation co-segregates with the disease, only fibroblasts from mutation carriers show nuclear blebbing and a similar phenotype was reported to be due to missense mutations in LMNA we conclude that we deal with a pathogenic mutation. We conclude that the phenotype is similar to Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy.},

  abstract = {ContextCurrent guidelines for cardiovascular risk detection are controversial with regard to the clinical utility of different lipid measures, non\textendash high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non\textendash HDL-C), lipid ratios, apolipoproteins, and C-reactive protein (CRP).ObjectiveTo directly compare the clinical utility of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL-C, non\textendash HDL-C, apolipoproteins A-I and B100, high-sensitivity CRP, and the ratios of total cholesterol to HDL-C, LDL-C to HDL-C, apolipoprotein B100 to apolipoprotein A-I, and apolipoprotein B100 to HDL-C as predictors of future cardiovascular events in women.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsProspective cohort study of 15~632 initially healthy US women aged 45 years or older (interquartile range, 48-59 years) who were enrolled between November 1992 and July 1995. All participants were followed up over a 10-year period for the occurrence of future cardiovascular events.Main Outcome MeasureHazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for first-ever major cardiovascular events (N~=~464) according to baseline levels of each biomarker.ResultsAfter adjustment for age, smoking status, blood pressure, diabetes, and body mass index, the HRs for future cardiovascular events for those in the extreme quintiles were 1.62 (95\% CI, 1.17-2.25) for LDL-C, 1.75 (95\% CI, 1.30-2.38) for apolipoprotein A-I, 2.08 (95\% CI, 1.45-2.97) for total cholesterol, 2.32 (95\% CI, 1.64-3.33) for HDL-C, 2.50 (95\% CI, 1.68-3.72) for apolipoprotein B100, 2.51 (95\% CI, 1.69-3.72) for non\textendash HDL-C, and 2.98 (95\% CI, 1.90-4.67) for high-sensitivity CRP (P\&lt;.001 for trend across all quintiles). The HRs for the lipid ratios were 3.01 (95\% CI, 2.01-4.50) for apolipoprotein B100 to apolipoprotein A-I, 3.18 (95\% CI, 2.12-4.75) for LDL-C to HDL-C, 3.56 (95\% CI, 2.31-5.47) for apolipoprotein B100 to HDL-C, and 3.81 (95\% CI, 2.47-5.86) for the total cholesterol to HDL-C (P\&lt;.001 for trend across all quintiles). The correlation coefficients between high-sensitivity CRP and the lipid parameters ranged from -0.33 to 0.15, and the clinical cut points for CRP of less than 1, 1 to 3, and higher than 3 mg/L provided prognostic information on risk across increasing levels of each lipid measure and lipid ratio.ConclusionsNon\textendash HDL-C and the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL-C were as good as or better than apolipoprotein fractions in the prediction of future cardiovascular events. After adjustment for age, blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, and obesity, high-sensitivity CRP added prognostic information beyond that conveyed by all lipid measures.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Precautionary warnings for severe myopathy and rhabdomyolysis from the coadministration of statins and fibrates have been well publicized. However, a recent cerivastatin labeling change made the combined use with fibric acid derivatives a contraindication. Practical recommendations for clinicians who care for patients with refractory mixed hyperlipidemia are needed.OBJECTIVE:To provide recommendations for clinicians in the treatment of refractory mixed hyperlipidemia.DATA SOURCES:A comprehensive MEDLINE (1966?July 2000) and bibliographic search was performed.DATA SYNTHESIS:Thirty-six published clinical trials and 29 case reports involving combination therapy with hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors and fibric acid derivatives regarding the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis or myopathy were reviewed. The literature review demonstrated that combination therapy with a statin and fibrate increases the risk of muscle damage, with an incidence of 0.12\%. Risk factors that predispose patients to myopathy caused by combination statin?fibrate therapy include increased age, female gender, renal or liver disease, diabetes, hypothyroidism, debilitated status, surgery, trauma, excessive alcohol intake, and heavy exercise.CONCLUSIONS:Combination therapy with a statin and fibrate offers significant therapeutic advantage for the treatment of severe or refractory mixed hyperlipidemia. Although such a combination does increase the risk of myopathy, with an incidence of approximately 0.12\%, this small risk of myopathy rarely outweighs the established morbidity and mortality benefits of achieving lipid goals. Nevertheless, a higher incidence of myopathy has been reported with statin monotherapy. When monotherapy with a statin fails to control mixed hyperlipidemia, combination therapy may be considered. Niacin may be added before a fibrate is considered, as it appears to have less risk of myopathy. Statin?fibrate combination therapy must be undertaken cautiously and only after careful risk?benefit analysis. Patient counseling on the risks and warning signs of myopathy is extremely important.},

Despoina Xenikaki provided the Working Party with invaluable administrative support. This guideline was reviewed and approved by the boards of all the professional societies.  View this table: JBS 2 Working Party  \#\#\# SUMMARY The aim of these new Joint British Societies' guidelines (JBS 2) developed by the British Cardiac Society, British Hypertension Society, Diabetes UK, HEART UK, Primary Care Cardiovascular Society, and The Stroke Association is to promote a consistent multidisciplinary approach to the management of people with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and those at high risk of developing symptomatic atherosclerotic disease. We recommend that CVD prevention in clinical practice should focus equally on (i) people with established atherosclerotic CVD, (ii) people with \ldots},

  abstract = {In recent years evidence from randomised controlled trials and meta analyses has strengthened our understanding of the effectiveness of lifestyle and therapeutic interventions in reducing coronary and other atherosclerotic risk. The European Societies of Cardiology, Atherosclerosis, and Hypertension joined forces to publish recommendations on the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) in clinical practice in 1994, and these were updated in 1998.1 This valuable collaboration between professional societies with a common interest in reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease in Europe encouraged the British Cardiac Society to cooperate with the British Hyperlipidaemia Association and the British Hypertension Society in preparing national recommendations, which have also been endorsed by the British Diabetic Association. Until now each society has worked independently, publishing separate guidelines on coronary prevention,2 and the management of hyperlipidaemia,3 ,4 and hypertension.5 This professional isolation is mirrored in clinical practice where a patient with angina can be under the care of specialists in cardiology, hypertension, lipids, and diabetes all in the same hospital. Too often the cardiologist restricts his view to coronary anatomy and ventricular function, and other specialists to management of single risk factors, and by so doing can overlook the other major determinants of a patient's prognosis. In putting forward joint recommendations on coronary prevention it is hoped that collaboration between professional societies will result in a more unified, and hence effective, approach to prevention of CHD in clinical practice. It is also appropriate to offer British recommendations in view of the substantially higher levels of CHD, and other atherosclerotic diseases, and their associated risk factors currently prevalent in Britain compared with many other European countries. To achieve a common approach it is necessary to include all cardiovascular risk factors, rather than focusing on a single risk factor and treating it in \ldots},

  abstract = {High blood cholesterol is typically considered a feature of wealthy western countries1,2. However, dietary and behavioural determinants of blood cholesterol are changing rapidly throughout the world3 and countries are using lipid-lowering medications at varying rates. These changes can have distinct effects on the levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol, which have different effects on human health4,5. However, the trends of HDL and non-HDL cholesterol levels over time have not been previously reported in a global analysis. Here we pooled 1,127~population-based studies that measured blood lipids in 102.6~million individuals aged 18~years and older to estimate trends from 1980 to 2018 in mean total, non-HDL and HDL cholesterol levels for 200~countries. Globally, there was little change in total or non-HDL cholesterol from 1980 to 2018. This was a net effect of increases in low- and middle-income countries, especially in east and southeast Asia, and decreases in high-income western countries, especially those in northwestern Europe, and in central and eastern Europe. As a result, countries with the highest level of non-HDL cholesterol\textemdash which is a marker of cardiovascular risk\textemdash changed from those in western Europe such as Belgium, Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Malta in 1980 to those in Asia and the Pacific, such as Tokelau, Malaysia, The Philippines and Thailand. In 2017, high non-HDL cholesterol was responsible for an estimated 3.9 million (95\% credible interval 3.7~million\textendash 4.2~million) worldwide deaths, half of which occurred in east, southeast and south Asia. The global repositioning of lipid-related risk, with non-optimal cholesterol shifting from a distinct feature of high-income countries in northwestern Europe, north America and Australasia to one that affects countries in east and southeast Asia and Oceania should motivate the use of population-based policies and personal interventions to improve nutrition and enhance access to treatment throughout the world.},

  abstract = {Studies in the 1950s and 1960s led to the formulation of the lipid hypothesis, which proposed that elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was causally related to coronary heart disease (CHD) and that reducing it would reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and other coronary events.3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, was an attractive target in the search for drugs to reduce plasma cholesterol concentrations.Compactin and lovastatin, natural products with a powerful inhibitory effect on HMG-CoA reductase, were discovered in the 1970s, and taken into clinical development as potential drugs for lowering LDL cholesterol.However, in 1980, trials with compactin were suspended for undisclosed reasons (rumoured to be related to serious animal toxicity). Because of the close structural similarity between compactin and lovastatin, clinical studies with lovastatin were also suspended, and additional animal safety studies initiated.In 1982 some small-scale clinical investigations of lovastatin in very high-risk patients were undertaken, in which dramatic reductions in LDL cholesterol were observed, with very few adverse effects. After the additional animal safety studies with lovastatin revealed no toxicity of the type thought to be associated with compactin, clinical studies resumed.Large-scale trials confirmed the effectiveness of lovastatin. Observed tolerability continued to be excellent, and lovastatin was approved by the US FDA in 1987. Lovastatin at its maximal recommended dose of 80 mg daily produced a mean reduction in LDL cholesterol of 40\%, a far greater reduction than could be obtained with any of the treatments available at the time. Equally important, the drug produced very few adverse effects, was easy for patients to take, and so was rapidly accepted by prescribers and patients. The only important adverse effect is myopathy/rhabdomyolysis. This is rare and occurs with all HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Several other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, now widely known as statins, subsequently became available for prescription: simvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, cerivastatin and rosuvastatin. The mechanism of the reduction in LDL cholesterol by statins is now known not to be simply reduction in cholesterol biosynthesis. Induction of the LDL receptor is crucial to their effectiveness. Although the basic lipid hypothesis had been validated by the late 1980s, the movement towards treating hypercholesterolaemia was questioned because overviews of trials of treatments from the pre-statin era suggested that although CHD events might be reduced, survival was not improved. However, large-scale, long-term trials published during the last decade, such as the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S, 1994), The Long-Term Intervention With Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease (LIPID, 1998) and the Heart Protection Study (HPS, 2002) with simvastatin, have now provided unequivocal evidence of a reduction in all-cause mortality. In 2001, cerivastatin was withdrawn by its manufacturer due to an excessive risk of rhabdomyolysis. In HPS the risk of serious cardiovascular events was reduced by simvastatin regardless of LDL-cholesterol level.},

  abstract = {Neurotensin (NT) is a gut hormone with broad effects on the cardiovascular system. Recent data suggested that circulating proneurotensin (pro-NT)\textemdash the stable precursor fragment of NT\textemdash could independently predict cardiovascular artery disease (CAD) development. However, serum pro-NT levels in patients with premature cardiovascular artery disease (PCAD) are still unknown. This study aims to determine serum pro-NT levels in patients with PCAD and investigate its relationship with PCAD risk. A total of 490 subjects, including 364 with PCAD and 126 without PCAD (NPCAD), and 182 controls were enrolled in the study. Data of baseline clinical parameters and biochemical variables were collected. Serum pro-NT levels were measured by ELISA. Serum pro-NT levels were higher in patients with PCAD than in controls (59.42 {$\pm$} 66.66 vs. 38.07 {$\pm$} 48.48 pg/mL, P {$<$} 0.05), especially in patients with BMI{$<$}25 kg/m2. Serum pro-NT levels were independently related to PCAD ({$\beta$} = 0.349, P {$<$} 0.001), and the association revealed a U-shaped curve characteristic between pro-NT tertiles and CAD risk in patients with premature CAD and controls. Subjects with low and high tertiles of pro-NT levels had 1.79-fold and 2.23-fold higher risks of PCAD, respectively, than subjects with median pro-NT levels (P {$<$} 0.05). After adjusting for age, gender, and BMI in Model 1 and other confounders in Model 2 and Model 3, the U-shaped relationship remained significant. Serum pro-NT levels were significantly increased in patients with PCAD. The association between pro-NT levels and PCAD risk presents a U-shaped curve characteristic, which demonstrated that subjects with lower and higher pro-NT levels both were more likely to have PCAD. Garlic (Allium sativum) is a widely known medicinal plant, potential of which remains to be fully evaluated. Its wide-range beneficial effects appear to be relevant for treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis and related diseases. It is generally believed that garlic-based preparations are able to improve lipid profile in humans, inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis, suppress low density lipoprotein oxidation, modulate blood pressure, suppress platelet aggregation, lower plasma fibrinogen level and increase fibrinolytic activity, thus providing clinically relevant cardioprotective and anti-atherosclerotic effects. It is important to assess the level of evidence available for different protective effects of garlic and to understand the underlying mechanisms. This information will allow adequate integration of garlic-based preparations to clinical practice. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of anti-atherosclerotic effects of garlic preparations, focusing on antihyperlipidemic, hypotensive, anti-platelet and direct anti-atherosclerotic activities of the medicinal plant. We also provide an overview of available meta-analyses and a number of clinical trials that assess the beneficial effects of garlic. To quantify the decline in recurrent major cardiovascular events (MCVE) risk in patients with clinically manifest vascular disease between 1996 and 2014 and to assess whether the improvements in recurrent MCVE-risk can be explained by reduced prevalence of risk factors, more medication use and less subclinical atherosclerosis. The study was conducted in the Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease (SMART) cohort in patients entering the cohort in the period 1996\textendash 2014. The prevalence of risk factors and subclinical atherosclerosis was measured at baseline. Incidence rates per 100 person-years for recurrent MCVE (including stroke, myocardial infarction, retinal bleeding, retinal infarction, terminal heart failure, sudden death, fatal rupture of abdominal aneurysm) were calculated, stratified by the year of study enrolment. For the attributable risk of changes in risk factors, risk factor treatment, and subclinical atherosclerosis on the incidence rates of recurrent MCVE, adjusted rate ratios were estimated with Poisson regression. 7216 patients had a median follow-up of 6.5 years (IQR 3.4\textendash 9.9). The crude incidence of recurrent MCVE declined by 53\% between 1996 and 2014 (from 3.68 to 1.73 events per 100 person-years) and by 75\% adjusted for age and sex. This improvement in vascular prognosis was 36\% explained by changes in risk factors, medication use and subclinical atherosclerosis. The risk of recurrent MCVE in patients with clinically manifest vascular disease has strongly declined in the period between 1996 and 2014. This is only partly attributable to lower prevalence of risk factors, improved medication use and less subclinical atherosclerosis. La paradoja del tabaco es un fen\'omeno insuficientemente explicado en estudios previos. Este estudio analiza el papel pron\'ostico del tabaquismo previo o activo en pacientes con s\'indrome coronario agudo. Obtuvimos los datos del registro ARIAM, entre 2001 y 2012. Se incluy\'o a 42.827 pacientes con s\'indrome coronario agudo (edad media 65 {$\pm$} 13 a\~nos, 26,4\% mujeres). Se analiz\'o la influencia del h\'abito tab\'aquico o de la condici\'on de exfumador en la mortalidad mediante an\'alisis multivariados. Los fumadores eran m\'as j\'ovenes, m\'as frecuentemente hombres, ten\'ian menos diabetes, hipertensi\'on e historia previa de insuficiencia cardiaca, ictus, arritmia e insuficiencia renal, as\'i como m\'as frecuentemente elevaci\'on del ST e historia familiar. Los exfumadores presentaban m\'as dislipidemia e historia de angina, infarto de miocardio, cardiopat\'ia isqu\'emica, vasculopat\'ia perif\'erica y broncopat\'ia cr\'onica. Fumadores y exfumadores desarrollaron menos frecuentemente shock cardiog\'enico (fumadores 4,2\%, exfumadores 4,7\% y no fumadores 6,9\%, p {$<$} 0,001). La mortalidad hospitalaria fue del 7,8\% en los no fumadores, un 4,9\% en los exfumadores y un 3,1\% en los fumadores (p {$<$} 0,001). En el an\'alisis multivariado, el car\'acter fumador perdi\'o su influencia en el pron\'ostico (\textendash 0,26\%, p = 0,52 mediante c\'alculo de probabilidad inversa; y +0,26\%, p = 0,691 mediante an\'alisis de propensi\'on). Sin embargo, el car\'acter exfumador mostr\'o una reducci\'on significativa de la mortalidad en ambos test (\textendash 2,4\% en el an\'alisis de probabilidad inversa, p {$<$} 0,001, y \textendash 1,5\% en el an\'alisis de propensi\'on, p = 0,005). La paradoja del tabaco es un hallazgo que puede explicarse por otros factores pron\'osticos. El abandono del h\'abito tab\'aquico previo a un ingreso por s\'indrome coronario agudo se asocia a un mejor pron\'ostico. The tobacco paradox is a phenomenon insufficiently explained by previous studies. This study analyses the prognostic role of prior or active smoking in patients with acute coronary syndrome. We obtained data from the ARIAM registry, between 2001 and 2012. The study included 42,827 patients with acute coronary syndrome (mean age, 65 {$\pm$} 13 years; 26.4\% women). The influence of smoking and that of being an ex-smoker on mortality was analysed using a multivariate analysis. The smokers were younger, were more often men, had less diabetes, hypertension and prior history of heart failure, stroke, arrhythmia and renal failure and more frequently had ST-elevation and a family history of smoking. The ex-smokers had more dyslipidaemia and history of angina, myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, peripheral vasculopathy and chronic bronchial disease. Smokers and ex-smokers less frequently developed cardiogenic shock (smokers 4.2\%, ex-smokers 4.7\% and nonsmokers 6.9\%, P{$<$}.001). Hospital mortality was 7.8\% for the nonsmokers, 4.9\% for the ex-smokers and 3.1\% for the smokers (P{$<$}.001). In the multivariate analysis, the smoker factor lost its influence in the prognosis (\textendash 0.26\%, p = .52 using an inverse probability calculation; and + 0.26\%, P=.691 using a propensity analysis). However, the exsmoker factor showed a significant reduction in mortality in both tests (-2.4\% in the inverse probability analysis, P{$<$}.001; and \textendash 1.5\% in the propensity analysis, P=.005). The tobacco paradox is a finding that could be explained by other prognostic factors. Smoking cessation prior to hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome is associated with a better prognosis.},

  abstract = {Background Antihypertensive medicines are effective in reducing adverse cardiovascular events. Our aim was to compare hypertension awareness, treatment, and control, and how they have changed over time, in high-income countries. Methods We used data from people aged 40\textendash 79 years who participated in 123 national health examination surveys from 1976 to 2017 in 12 high-income countries: Australia, Canada, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Spain, the UK, and the USA. We calculated the proportion of participants with hypertension, which was defined as systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or more, or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or more, or being on pharmacological treatment for hypertension, who were aware of their condition, who were treated, and whose hypertension was controlled (ie, lower than 140/90 mm Hg). Findings Data from 526\hphantom{,}336 participants were used in these analyses. In their most recent surveys, Canada, South Korea, Australia, and the UK had the lowest prevalence of hypertension, and Finland the highest. In the 1980s and early 1990s, treatment rates were at most 40\% and control rates were less than 25\% in most countries and age and sex groups. Over the time period assessed, hypertension awareness and treatment increased and control rate improved in all 12 countries, with South Korea and Germany experiencing the largest improvements. Most of the observed increase occurred in the 1990s and early-mid 2000s, having plateaued since in most countries. In their most recent surveys, Canada, Germany, South Korea, and the USA had the highest rates of awareness, treatment, and control, whereas Finland, Ireland, Japan, and Spain had the lowest. Even in the best performing countries, treatment coverage was at most 80\% and control rates were less than 70\%. Interpretation Hypertension awareness, treatment, and control have improved substantially in high-income countries since the 1980s and 1990s. However, control rates have plateaued in the past decade, at levels lower than those in high-quality hypertension programmes. There is substantial variation across countries in the rates of hypertension awareness, treatment, and control. Funding Wellcome Trust and WHO.},
