	abstract = {Background
Data for trends in blood pressure are needed to understand the effects of its dietary, lifestyle, and pharmacological determinants; set intervention priorities; and evaluate national programmes. However, few worldwide analyses of trends in blood pressure have been done. We estimated worldwide trends in population mean systolic blood pressure ({SBP}).
Methods
We estimated trends and their uncertainties in mean {SBP} for adults 25 years and older in 199 countries and territories. We obtained data from published and unpublished health examination surveys and epidemiological studies (786 country-years and 5·4 million participants). For each sex, we used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate mean {SBP} by age, country, and year, accounting for whether a study was nationally representative.
Findings
In 2008, age-standardised mean {SBP} worldwide was 128·1 mm Hg (95\% uncertainty interval 126·7–129·4) in men and 124·4 mm Hg (123·0–125·9) in women. Globally, between 1980 and 2008, {SBP} decreased by 0·8 mm Hg per decade (−0·4 to 2·2, posterior probability of being a true decline=0·90) in men and 1·0 mm Hg per decade (−0·3 to 2·3, posterior probability=0·93) in women. Female {SBP} decreased by 3·5 mm Hg or more per decade in western Europe and Australasia (posterior probabilities ≥0·999). Male {SBP} fell most in high-income North America, by 2·8 mm Hg per decade (1·3–4·5, posterior probability {\textgreater}0·999), followed by Australasia and western Europe where it decreased by more than 2·0 mm Hg per decade (posterior probabilities {\textgreater}0·98). {SBP} rose in Oceania, east Africa, and south and southeast Asia for both sexes, and in west Africa for women, with the increases ranging 0·8–1·6 mm Hg per decade in men (posterior probabilities 0·72–0·91) and 1·0–2·7 mm Hg per decade for women (posterior probabilities 0·75–0·98). Female {SBP} was highest in some east and west African countries, with means of 135 mm Hg or greater. Male {SBP} was highest in Baltic and east and west African countries, where mean {SBP} reached 138 mm Hg or more. Men and women in western Europe had the highest {SBP} in high-income regions.
Interpretation
On average, global population {SBP} decreased slightly since 1980, but trends varied significantly across regions and countries. {SBP} is currently highest in low-income and middle-income countries. Effective population-based and personal interventions should be targeted towards low-income and middle-income countries.

	abstract = {Improving health worldwide will require rigorous quantification of population-level trends in health status. However, global-level surveys are not available, forcing researchers to rely on fragmentary country-specific data of varying quality. We present a Bayesian model that systematically combines disparate data to make country-, region- and global-level estimates of time trends in important health indicators. The model allows for time and age nonlinearity, and it borrows strength in time, age, covariates, and within and across regional country clusters to make estimates where data are sparse. The Bayesian approach allows us to account for uncertainty from the various aspects of missingness as well as sampling and parameter uncertainty. {MCMC} sampling allows for inference in a highdimensional, constrained parameter space, while providing posterior draws that allow straightforward inference on the wide variety of functionals of interest. Here we use blood pressure as an example health metric. High blood pressure is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death worldwide. The results highlight a risk transition, with decreasing blood pressure in high-income regions and increasing levels in many lowerincome regions.},

	abstract = {Background
Antihypertensive medicines are effective in reducing adverse cardiovascular events. Our aim was to compare hypertension awareness, treatment, and control, and how they have changed over time, in high-income countries.
Methods
We used data from people aged 40–79 years who participated in 123 national health examination surveys from 1976 to 2017 in 12 high-income countries: Australia, Canada, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Spain, the {UK}, and the {USA}. We calculated the proportion of participants with hypertension, which was defined as systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or more, or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or more, or being on pharmacological treatment for hypertension, who were aware of their condition, who were treated, and whose hypertension was controlled (ie, lower than 140/90 mm Hg).
Findings
Data from 526 336 participants were used in these analyses. In their most recent surveys, Canada, South Korea, Australia, and the {UK} had the lowest prevalence of hypertension, and Finland the highest. In the 1980s and early 1990s, treatment rates were at most 40\% and control rates were less than 25\% in most countries and age and sex groups. Over the time period assessed, hypertension awareness and treatment increased and control rate improved in all 12 countries, with South Korea and Germany experiencing the largest improvements. Most of the observed increase occurred in the 1990s and early-mid 2000s, having plateaued since in most countries. In their most recent surveys, Canada, Germany, South Korea, and the {USA} had the highest rates of awareness, treatment, and control, whereas Finland, Ireland, Japan, and Spain had the lowest. Even in the best performing countries, treatment coverage was at most 80\% and control rates were less than 70\%.
Interpretation
Hypertension awareness, treatment, and control have improved substantially in high-income countries since the 1980s and 1990s. However, control rates have plateaued in the past decade, at levels lower than those in high-quality hypertension programmes. There is substantial variation across countries in the rates of hypertension awareness, treatment, and control.

	abstract = {Background
Data for trends in serum cholesterol are needed to understand the effects of its dietary, lifestyle, and pharmacological determinants; set intervention priorities; and evaluate national programmes. Previous analyses of trends in serum cholesterol were limited to a few countries, with no consistent and comparable global analysis. We estimated worldwide trends in population mean serum total cholesterol.
Methods
We estimated trends and their uncertainties in mean serum total cholesterol for adults 25 years and older in 199 countries and territories. We obtained data from published and unpublished health examination surveys and epidemiological studies (321 country-years and 3·0 million participants). For each sex, we used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate mean total cholesterol by age, country, and year, accounting for whether a study was nationally representative.
Findings
In 2008, age-standardised mean total cholesterol worldwide was 4·64 mmol/L (95\% uncertainty interval 4·51–4·76) for men and 4·76 mmol/L (4·62–4·91) for women. Globally, mean total cholesterol changed little between 1980 and 2008, falling by less than 0·1 mmol/L per decade in men and women. Total cholesterol fell in the high-income region consisting of Australasia, North America, and western Europe, and in central and eastern Europe; the regional declines were about 0·2 mmol/L per decade for both sexes, with posterior probabilities of these being true declines 0·99 or greater. Mean total cholesterol increased in east and southeast Asia and Pacific by 0·08 mmol/L per decade (−0·06 to 0·22, posterior probability=0·86) in men and 0·09 mmol/L per decade (−0·07 to 0·26, posterior probability=0·86) in women. Despite converging trends, serum total cholesterol in 2008 was highest in the high-income region consisting of Australasia, North America, and western Europe; the regional mean was 5·24 mmol/L (5·08–5·39) for men and 5·23 mmol/L (5·03–5·43) for women. It was lowest in sub-Saharan Africa at 4·08 mmol/L (3·82–4·34) for men and 4·27 mmol/L (3·99–4·56) for women.
Interpretation
Nutritional policies and pharmacological interventions should be used to accelerate improvements in total cholesterol in regions with decline and to curb or prevent the rise in Asian populations and elsewhere. Population-based surveillance of cholesterol needs to be improved in low-income and middle-income countries.

	abstract = {Background
Excess bodyweight is a major public health concern. However, few worldwide comparative analyses of long-term trends of body-mass index ({BMI}) have been done, and none have used recent national health examination surveys. We estimated worldwide trends in population mean {BMI}.
Methods
We estimated trends and their uncertainties of mean {BMI} for adults 20 years and older in 199 countries and territories. We obtained data from published and unpublished health examination surveys and epidemiological studies (960 country-years and 9·1 million participants). For each sex, we used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate mean {BMI} by age, country, and year, accounting for whether a study was nationally representative.
Findings
Between 1980 and 2008, mean {BMI} worldwide increased by 0·4 kg/m2 per decade (95\% uncertainty interval 0·2–0·6, posterior probability of being a true increase {\textgreater}0·999) for men and 0·5 kg/m2 per decade (0·3–0·7, posterior probability {\textgreater}0·999) for women. National {BMI} change for women ranged from non-significant decreases in 19 countries to increases of more than 2·0 kg/m2 per decade (posterior probabilities {\textgreater}0·99) in nine countries in Oceania. Male {BMI} increased in all but eight countries, by more than 2 kg/m2 per decade in Nauru and Cook Islands (posterior probabilities {\textgreater}0·999). Male and female {BMIs} in 2008 were highest in some Oceania countries, reaching 33·9 kg/m2 (32·8–35·0) for men and 35·0 kg/m2 (33·6–36·3) for women in Nauru. Female {BMI} was lowest in Bangladesh (20·5 kg/m2, 19·8–21·3) and male {BMI} in Democratic Republic of the Congo 19·9 kg/m2 (18·2–21·5), with {BMI} less than 21·5 kg/m2 for both sexes in a few countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and east, south, and southeast Asia. The {USA} had the highest {BMI} of high-income countries. In 2008, an estimated 1·46 billion adults (1·41–1·51 billion) worldwide had {BMI} of 25 kg/m2 or greater, of these 205 million men (193–217 million) and 297 million women (280–315 million) were obese.
Interpretation
Globally, mean {BMI} has increased since 1980. The trends since 1980, and mean population {BMI} in 2008, varied substantially between nations. Interventions and policies that can curb or reverse the increase, and mitigate the health effects of high {BMI} by targeting its metabolic mediators, are needed in most countries.

	abstract = {Background
Data for trends in glycaemia and diabetes prevalence are needed to understand the effects of diet and lifestyle within populations, assess the performance of interventions, and plan health services. No consistent and comparable global analysis of trends has been done. We estimated trends and their uncertainties in mean fasting plasma glucose ({FPG}) and diabetes prevalence for adults aged 25 years and older in 199 countries and territories.
Methods
We obtained data from health examination surveys and epidemiological studies (370 country-years and 2·7 million participants). We converted systematically between different glycaemic metrics. For each sex, we used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate mean {FPG} and its uncertainty by age, country, and year, accounting for whether a study was nationally, subnationally, or community representative.
Findings
In 2008, global age-standardised mean {FPG} was 5·50 mmol/L (95\% uncertainty interval 5·37–5·63) for men and 5·42 mmol/L (5·29–5·54) for women, having risen by 0·07 mmol/L and 0·09 mmol/L per decade, respectively. Age-standardised adult diabetes prevalence was 9·8\% (8·6–11·2) in men and 9·2\% (8·0–10·5) in women in 2008, up from 8·3\% (6·5–10·4) and 7·5\% (5·8–9·6) in 1980. The number of people with diabetes increased from 153 (127–182) million in 1980, to 347 (314–382) million in 2008. We recorded almost no change in mean {FPG} in east and southeast Asia and central and eastern Europe. Oceania had the largest rise, and the highest mean {FPG} (6·09 mmol/L, 5·73–6·49 for men; 6·08 mmol/L, 5·72–6·46 for women) and diabetes prevalence (15·5\%, 11·6–20·1 for men; and 15·9\%, 12·1–20·5 for women) in 2008. Mean {FPG} and diabetes prevalence in 2008 were also high in south Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and central Asia, north Africa, and the Middle East. Mean {FPG} in 2008 was lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, east and southeast Asia, and high-income Asia-Pacific. In high-income subregions, western Europe had the smallest rise, 0·07 mmol/L per decade for men and 0·03 mmol/L per decade for women; North America had the largest rise, 0·18 mmol/L per decade for men and 0·14 mmol/L per decade for women.
Interpretation
Glycaemia and diabetes are rising globally, driven both by population growth and ageing and by increasing age-specific prevalences. Effective preventive interventions are needed, and health systems should prepare to detect and manage diabetes and its sequelae.

	abstract = {The Bayesian approach to data analysis provides a powerful way to handle uncertainty in all observations, model parameters, and model structure using probability theory. Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

	abstract = {High blood cholesterol is typically considered a feature of wealthy western countries1,2. However, dietary and behavioural determinants of blood cholesterol are changing rapidly throughout the world3 and countries are using lipid-lowering medications at varying rates. These changes can have distinct effects on the levels of high-density lipoprotein ({HDL}) cholesterol and non-{HDL} cholesterol, which have different effects on human health4,5. However, the trends of {HDL} and non-{HDL} cholesterol levels over time have not been previously reported in a global analysis. Here we pooled 1,127 population-based studies that measured blood lipids in 102.6 million individuals aged 18 years and older to estimate trends from 1980 to 2018 in mean total, non-{HDL} and {HDL} cholesterol levels for 200 countries. Globally, there was little change in total or non-{HDL} cholesterol from 1980 to 2018. This was a net effect of increases in low- and middle-income countries, especially in east and southeast Asia, and decreases in high-income western countries, especially those in northwestern Europe, and in central and eastern Europe. As a result, countries with the highest level of non-{HDL} cholesterol—which is a marker of cardiovascular risk—changed from those in western Europe such as Belgium, Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Malta in 1980 to those in Asia and the Pacific, such as Tokelau, Malaysia, The Philippines and Thailand. In 2017, high non-{HDL} cholesterol was responsible for an estimated 3.9 million (95\% credible interval 3.7 million–4.2 million) worldwide deaths, half of which occurred in east, southeast and south Asia. The global repositioning of lipid-related risk, with non-optimal cholesterol shifting from a distinct feature of high-income countries in northwestern Europe, north America and Australasia to one that affects countries in east and southeast Asia and Oceania should motivate the use of population-based policies and personal interventions to improve nutrition and enhance access to treatment throughout the world.},

	abstract = {Purpose
We sought to determine trends in the prevalence, awareness, treatment and control of high low-density lipoprotein ({LDL}) cholesterol among U.S. adults.
Methods
Data from 6497 participants of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ({NHANES}) conducted in 1988−1994 and 5626 participants of {NHANES} 1999−2004 were compared. High {LDL} cholesterol was defined using risk-specific cut-points from the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel {III} guidelines.
Results
The age-standardized percentage of U.S. adults with high {LDL} cholesterol was 26.6\% in 1988−1994 and 25.3\% in 1999−2004 (P = 0.28). Between 1988−1994 and 1999−2004, awareness increased from 39.2\% to 63.0\%, and use of pharmacologic lipid-lowering treatment increased from 11.7\% to 40.8\% (each p {\textless} 0.001). {LDL} cholesterol control increased from 4.0\% to 25.1\% among those with high {LDL} cholesterol (p {\textless} 0.001). In 1999−2004, rates of {LDL} cholesterol control were lower among adults ages 20−49 years compared with those age 65 years or older (13.9\% vs. 30.3\%; p {\textless} 0.001); non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican-Americans compared with non-Hispanic whites (17.2\% and 16.5\% vs. 26.9\%, respectively; p = 0.05 and p = 0.008); and males compared with females (22.6\% vs. 28.0\%; p = 0.01).
Conclusions
Continued efforts are needed to lower the burden of high {LDL} cholesterol and increase {LDL} cholesterol control, especially among populations with low control rates.},

	abstract = {Marked increases in the awareness, treatment, and control of high low-density lipoprotein ({LDL}) cholesterol occurred among United States ({US}) adults from 1988–1994 to 1999–2004. An update to the Third Adult Treatment Panel guidelines was published in 2004, and it is unknown if these improvements have continued since the publication of these revised treatment recommendations. The aim of this study was to determine trends in the awareness, treatment, and control of high {LDL} cholesterol among {US} adults from 1999–2000 to 2009–2010 using nationally representative samples of {US} adults aged ≥20 years from 6 consecutive National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys ({NHANES}) in 1999–2000 (n = 1,659), 2001–2002 (n = 1,897), 2003–2004 (n = 1,698), 2005–2006 (n = 1,692), 2007–2008 (n = 2,044), and 2009–2010 (n = 2,318). {LDL} cholesterol was measured after an overnight fast, and high {LDL} cholesterol and controlled {LDL} cholesterol were defined using the 2004 updated Third Adult Treatment Panel guidelines. Awareness and treatment of high cholesterol were defined using self-report. Among {US} adults, the prevalence of high {LDL} cholesterol did not change from 1999–2000 (37.2\%) to 2009–2010 (37.8\%). Awareness of high {LDL} cholesterol increased from 48.9\% in 1999–2000 to 62.8\% in 2003–2004 but did not increase further through 2009–2010 (61.5\%). Among those aware of having high {LDL} cholesterol, treatment increased from 41.3\% in 1999–2000 to 72.6\% in 2007–2008 and was 70.0\% in 2009–2010. Among {US} adults receiving treatment for high {LDL} cholesterol, the percentage with controlled {LDL} cholesterol increased from 45.0\% in 1999–2000 to 65.3\% in 2005–2006 and had decreased slightly by 2009–2010 (63.6\%). In conclusion, high {LDL} cholesterol remains common among {US} adults. Additional efforts are needed to prevent high {LDL} cholesterol and increase the awareness, treatment, and control of high {LDL} cholesterol among {US} adults.},

	abstract = {Background Over a 14-year period, age-adjusted high total cholesterol (≥240 mg/{dL}) in the United States declined from 18.3\% in 1999 to 2000 to 11.0\% in 2013 to 2014, coinciding with the 2001 National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel ({ATP})-{III} guidelines that endorsed low-density lipoprotein ({LDL})-cholesterol blood value goals. Statin treatment recommendations were revised by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association ({ACC}/{AHA}) in November 2013 to a “risk-based prescription” approach that did not utilize blood cholesterol values. This increased dosage and expanded the statin-eligible population by an estimated 12.8 million {US} adults. These changes should further lower total and {LDL} cholesterol concentrations nationally. Methods We examined data from 507 752 patients nationally aged ≥16 years whose fasting bloods were sent to Boston Heart Diagnostics for direct {LDL}-cholesterol measurements. Between 2012 and 2017, age-adjusted concentrations were examined by analysis of covariance and {LDL}-cholesterol ≥160 mg/{dL} by logistic regression. Results Contrary to expectations, age-adjusted mean {LDL}-cholesterol concentrations (±{SE}, mg/{dL}) increased significantly (P {\textless} 10−16) in men (2012:113.8 ± 0.3; 2013:115.3 ± 0.2; 2014:114.7 ± 0.2; 2015:116.0 ± 0.2; 2016:117.6 ± 0.2; and 2017:117.1 ± 0.2 mg/{dL}) and women (2012:119.5 ± 0.3; 2013:120.7 ± 0.2; 2014:119.8 ± 0.02; 2015:120.8 ± 0.2; 2016:122.7 ± 0.1; and 2017:123.8 ± 0.2 mg/{dL}). The percentage with {LDL}-cholesterol ≥160 mg/{dL} also increased significantly (P {\textless} 10−9) in men and women. Similar results were obtained for ages 40 to 75 years olds (corresponding to {ACC}/{AHA} guidelines). Conclusion These results provide additional evidence that declining blood {LDL}-cholesterol levels observed following the {ATP}-{III} recommendations, did not further decline (actually increased) following the 2013 {ACC}/{AHA} recommendations.},

	abstract = {Objectives Elevated blood cholesterol is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Cholesterol level surveillance is necessary to study population disease burden, consider priorities for prevention and intervention and understand the effect of diet, lifestyle and treatment. Previous studies show a cholesterol decline in recent decades but lack data to follow individuals born in different decades throughout life.
Methods We investigated changes in age-specific and birth cohort-specific total cholesterol ({TC}) levels in 43 710 women and men born in 1905–1977 (aged 20–95 years at screening) in the population-based Tromsø Study. Fifty-nine per cent of the participants had more than one and up to six repeated {TC} measurements during 1979–2016. Linear mixed models were used to test for time trends.
Results Mean {TC} decreased during 1979–2016 in both women and men and in all age groups. The decrease in {TC} in age group 40–49 years was 1.2 mmol/L in women and 1.0 mmol/L in men. Both the 80th and the 20th percentile of the population {TC} distribution decreased in both sexes and all age groups. Longitudinal analysis showed that {TC} increased with age to a peak around middle age followed by a decrease. At any given age, {TC} significantly decreased with increase in year born. Lipid-lowering drug use was rare in 1994, increased thereafter, but was low ({\textless}3\% in women and {\textless}5\% in men) among those younger than 50 years in all surveys. Between 1994 and 2016, lipid-lowering drug treatment in individuals 50 years and older explained 21\% and 28\% of the decrease in {TC} levels in women and men, respectively.
Conclusions We found a substantial decrease in mean {TC} levels in the general population between 1979 and 2016 in all age groups. In birth cohorts, {TC} increased with age to a peak around middle age followed by a decrease.},

	abstract = {Although high-density lipoprotein ({HDL}) and non-{HDL} cholesterol have opposite associations with coronary heart disease, multi-country reports of lipid trends only use total cholesterol ({TC}). Our aim was to compare trends in total, {HDL} and non-{HDL} cholesterol and the total-to-{HDL} cholesterol ratio in Asian and Western countries.We pooled 458 population-based studies with 82.1 million participants in 23 Asian and Western countries. We estimated changes in mean total, {HDL} and non-{HDL} cholesterol and mean total-to-{HDL} cholesterol ratio by country, sex and age group.Since ∼1980, mean {TC} increased in Asian countries. In Japan and South Korea, the {TC} rise was due to rising {HDL} cholesterol, which increased by up to 0.17 mmol/L per decade in Japanese women; in China, it was due to rising non-{HDL} cholesterol. {TC} declined in Western countries, except in Polish men. The decline was largest in Finland and Norway, at ∼0.4 mmol/L per decade. The decline in {TC} in most Western countries was the net effect of an increase in {HDL} cholesterol and a decline in non-{HDL} cholesterol, with the {HDL} cholesterol increase largest in New Zealand and Switzerland. Mean total-to-{HDL} cholesterol ratio declined in Japan, South Korea and most Western countries, by as much as ∼0.7 per decade in Swiss men (equivalent to ∼26\% decline in coronary heart disease risk per decade). The ratio increased in China.{HDL} cholesterol has risen and the total-to-{HDL} cholesterol ratio has declined in many Western countries, Japan and South Korea, with only a weak correlation with changes in {TC} or non-{HDL} cholesterol.},

	abstract = {Background
The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Cholesterol Management Guideline identifies 4 statin-eligible groups: (1) known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ({ASCVD}) aged ≥21 years, (2) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ({LDL}-C) ≥ 190 mg/{dL} (4.9 mmol/L) aged ≥21 years, (3) diabetes mellitus aged 40 to 75 years with {LDL}-C 70 to 189 mg/{dL} (1.8–4.9 mmol/L), or (4) ≥7.5\% 10-year {ASCVD} risk aged 40 to 75 years with {LDL}-C 70 to 189 mg/{dL} (1.8–4.9 mmol/L).
Objectives
We examined the number of statin-eligible {US} adults, statin use, {LDL}-C goal attainment, and adherence to lifestyle management.
Methods
We identified subjects from the {US} National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011–2012 in the 4 statin-eligible groups, proportion on statin, proportion at recommended {LDL}-C levels using National Lipid Association goals ({\textless}70 mg/{dL} [1.8 mmol/L] for very high risk and {\textless}100 mg/{dL} [2.6 mmol/L] for others), and adherence to lifestyle measures.
Results
Of 5206 adults (representing 219 million), 1677 adults representing 62.6 million adults fit into 1 of the 4 statin-eligible groups. Statin use was 63.7\% for the {ASCVD}, 61.4\% for the {LDL}-C ≥ 190 mg/{dL} (4.9 mmol/L), 43.2\% for the diabetes mellitus, and 27.2\% for the 10-year risk ≥7.5\% groups. Of those on statins with {LDL}-C measured, 79.7\%, 98.0\%, 42.3\%, and 46.8\% were not at {LDL}-C goal. Adherence to recommended {\textless}6\% calories from saturated fat ranged from 3.3\% to 6.4\% and ≥40 minutes of physical activity ≥3 times a week from 54.7\% to 65.1\% across statin-eligible groups.
Conclusion
Many {US} adults eligible to receive statins based on American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines are not taking statins, and {LDL}-C levels still remain suboptimal.},

	abstract = {Background The 2013 guidelines of the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association ({ACC}–{AHA}) for the treatment of cholesterol expand the indications for statin therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.
Methods Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys of 2005 to 2010, we estimated the number, and summarized the risk-factor profile, of persons for whom statin therapy would be recommended (i.e., eligible persons) under the new {ACC}–{AHA} guidelines, as compared with the guidelines of the Third Adult Treatment Panel ({ATP} {III}) of the National Cholesterol Education Program, and extrapolated the results to a population of 115.4 million U.S. adults between the ages of 40 and 75 years. Drs. Sniderman and Peterson contributed equally to this article. This article was published on March 19, 2014, at {NEJM}.org. N Engl J Med 2014;370:1422-31 {DOI}: 10.1056/{NEJMoa}1315665 Copyright © 2014 Massachusetts Medical Society.
Results As compared with the {ATP}-{III} guidelines, the new guidelines would increase the number of U.S. adults receiving or eligible for statin therapy from 43.2 million (37.5\%) to 56.0 million (48.6\%). Most of this increase in numbers (10.4 million of 12.8 million) would occur among adults without cardiovascular disease. Among adults between the ages of 60 and 75 years without cardiovascular disease who are not receiving statin therapy, the percentage who would be eligible for such therapy would increase from 30.4\% to 87.4\% among men and from 21.2\% to 53.6\% among women. This effect would be driven largely by an increased number of adults who would be classified solely on the basis of their 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event. Those who would be newly eligible for statin therapy include more men than women and persons with a higher blood pressure but a markedly lower level of lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol. As compared with the {ATP}-{III} guidelines, the new guidelines would recommend statin therapy for more adults who would be expected to have future cardiovascular events (higher sensitivity) but would also include many adults who would not have future events (lower specificity).
Conclusions The new {ACC}–{AHA} guidelines for the management of cholesterol would increase the number of adults who would be eligible for statin therapy by 12.8 million, with the increase seen mostly among older adults without cardiovascular disease.

	abstract = {Many developments have occurred since the publication of the widely-used 2009 Canadian Cardiovascular Society ({CCS}) Dyslipidemia guidelines. Here, we present an updated version of the guidelines, incorporating new recommendations based on recent findings and harmonizing {CCS} guidelines with those from other Societies. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation ({GRADE}) system was used, per present standards of the {CCS}. The total cardiovascular disease Framingham Risk Score ({FRS}), modified for a family history of premature coronary disease, is recommended for risk assessment. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol remains the primary target of therapy. However, non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol has been added to apolipoprotein B as an alternate target. There is an increased emphasis on treatment of higher risk patients, including those with chronic kidney disease and high risk hypertension. The primary panel has recommended a judicious use of secondary testing for subjects in whom the need for statin therapy is unclear. Expanded information on health behaviours is presented and is the backbone of risk reduction in all subjects. Finally, a systematic approach to statin intolerance is advocated to maximize appropriate use of lipid-lowering therapy. This document presents the recommendations and principal conclusions of this process. Along with associated Supplementary Material that can be accessed online, this document will be part of a program of knowledge translation. The goal is to increase the appropriate use of evidence-based cardiovascular disease event risk assessment in the management of dyslipidemia as a fundamental means of reducing global risk in the Canadian population.
Résumé
De nombreux développements sont survenus depuis la publication communément utilisée des Lignes directrices 2009 de la Société canadienne de cardiologie ({SCC}) sur la dyslipidémie. Nous présentons ici une version mise à jour des lignes directrices, qui inclut des nouvelles recommandations fondées sur des résultats récents qui harmonisent les lignes directrices de la {SCC} à celles d'autres sociétés. La méthode {GRADE} (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) a été utilisée selon les normes actuelles de la {SCC}. Le score de risque cardiovasculaire global de Framingham ({SRF}) total sur les maladies cardiovasculaires modifié pour tenir compte des antécédents familiaux de coronaropathie prématurée est recommandé pour l'évaluation du risque. Le cholestérol à lipoprotéines de faible densité demeure la cible principale du traitement. Cependant, le cholestérol non à lipoprotéines de haute densité a été ajouté à l'apolipoprotéine B comme autre cible. L'accent est davantage mis sur le traitement des patients exposés à un risque élevé, incluant ceux ayant une maladie rénale chronique et une hypertension à risque élevé. Le panel principal a recommandé une utilisation judicieuse d'examens secondaires des sujets chez qui la nécessité d'un traitement par des statines est incertaine. De plus en plus de renseignements sur les comportements en matière de santé sont présentés et sont les bases de la réduction du risque chez tous les sujets. Finalement, une approche systématique sur l'intolérance aux statines est recommandée pour optimiser l'utilisation de traitements hypolipidémiants. Ce document présente les recommandations et les conclusions principales de ce processus. Par les contenus complémentaires associés qui peuvent être consultés en ligne, ce document fera partie d'un programme d'application des connaissances. Le but est d'accroître l'utilisation appropriée de l'évaluation des risques d'événements cardiovasculaires fondée sur les preuves dans la prise en charge de la dyslipidémie en tant que moyen fondamental pour réduire le risque global dans la population canadienne.},

	abstract = {The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ({ACC}/{AHA}) cholesterol guideline advocated several changes from the previous Adult Treatment Panel {III} guidelines. Assuming full implementation, the 2013 {ACC}/{AHA} guideline would identify [almost equal to]13 million Americans as newly eligible for consideration of statin therapy. Three features of the 2013 {ACC}/{AHA} guideline primarily responsible for these differences are the specific risk assessment tool endorsed, the risk threshold considered sufficient to warrant primary prevention statin therapy, and the decision not to include cholesterol treatment targets. There is no consensus among international guidelines on the optimal approach to these 3 components. The 2013 {ACC}/{AHA} guideline recommends assessing absolute risk with the Pooled Cohort equations, which were developed to improve on previous risk assessment models by including stroke as an outcome and by broadening racial and geographic diversity. Each of the leading international guidelines recommends a different equation for absolute risk assessment. The 2013 {ACC}/{AHA} guideline advises consideration of statin therapy for an estimated 10-year risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease of {\textgreater}=7.5\%, which is lower than the thresholds recommended by other leading international guidelines. Lastly, the 2013 {ACC}/{AHA} guideline does not endorse a treat-to-target strategy but instead specifies the appropriate intensity of statin for each risk category. This approach is shared by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines but differs from other international guidelines. In this review, we summarize the 2013 {ACC}/{AHA} cholesterol guideline recommendations and compare them with recommendations from Adult Treatment Panel {III} and other leading international guidelines., (C) 2016  by the American College of Cardiology Foundation and the American Heart Association, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background
Treatment of cardiovascular risk factors based on disease risk depends on valid risk prediction equations. We aimed to develop, and apply in example countries, a risk prediction equation for cardiovascular disease (consisting here of coronary heart disease and stroke) that can be recalibrated and updated for application in different countries with routinely available information.
Methods
We used data from eight prospective cohort studies to estimate coefficients of the risk equation with proportional hazard regressions. The risk prediction equation included smoking, blood pressure, diabetes, and total cholesterol, and allowed the effects of sex and age on cardiovascular disease to vary between cohorts or countries. We developed risk equations for fatal cardiovascular disease and for fatal plus non-fatal cardiovascular disease. We validated the risk equations internally and also using data from three cohorts that were not used to create the equations. We then used the risk prediction equation and data from recent (2006 or later) national health surveys to estimate the proportion of the population at different levels of cardiovascular disease risk in 11 countries from different world regions (China, Czech Republic, Denmark, England, Iran, Japan, Malawi, Mexico, South Korea, Spain, and {USA}).
Findings
The risk score discriminated well in internal and external validations, with C statistics generally 70\% or more. At any age and risk factor level, the estimated 10 year fatal cardiovascular disease risk varied substantially between countries. The prevalence of people at high risk of fatal cardiovascular disease was lowest in South Korea, Spain, and Denmark, where only 5–10\% of men and women had more than a 10\% risk, and 62–76\% of men and 79–82\% of women had less than a 3\% risk. Conversely, the proportion of people at high risk of fatal cardiovascular disease was largest in China and Mexico. In China, 33\% of men and 28\% of women had a 10-year risk of fatal cardiovascular disease of 10\% or more, whereas in Mexico, the prevalence of this high risk was 15\% for men and 11\% for women. The prevalence of less than a 3\% risk was 37\% for men and 42\% for women in China, and 54\% for men and 68\% for women in Mexico.
Interpretation
We developed a cardiovascular disease risk equation that can be recalibrated for application in different countries with routinely available information. The estimated percentage of people at high risk of fatal cardiovascular disease was higher in low-income and middle-income countries than in high-income countries.
